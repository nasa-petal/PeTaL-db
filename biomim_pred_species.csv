Nest construction behaviour of túngara frogs, Engystomops pustulosus, has features that may circumvent these problems. Pairs build nests in periodic bursts of foam production and egg deposition, three discrete phases being discernible. The first is characterized by a bubble raft without egg deposition and an approximately linear increase in duration of mixing events with time. This phase may reduce initial over-dispersion of foam precursor materials until a critical concentration is achieved. The main building phase is marked by mixing events and start-to-start intervals being nearly constant in duration. During the final phase, mixing events do not change in duration but intervals between them increase in an exponential-like fashion. Pairs joining a colonial nesting abbreviate their initial phase, presumably by exploiting a pioneer pair's bubble raft, thereby reducing energy and material expenditure, and time exposed to predators. Finally, eggs are deposited only in the centre of nests with a continuously produced, approximately 1 cm deep egg-free cortex that protectively encloses hatched larvae in stranded nests.",0.005399006,0.002109709,0.013186486,0.004126454,0.021882577,0.006931718,0.003900202,0.02537225,0.008047057,0.007391842,0.01219218,0.003647751,0.0123947,0.004428756,0.021770004,0.005145517,0.004494175,0.005006751,0.013850511,0.004746569,0.004578424,0.005577957,0.005919506,0.311844,0.010476196,0.005763929,0.01462313,0.011381056,0.003392118,"['engystomops pustulosus', 'tungara frog', 'frogs']","[0.015873015873015, 0.015873015873015, 0.031746031746031]","[0.5, 0.5, 1.0]"

The geomagnetic field may be used by animals both to indicate direction and to locate position. In birds, directional information appears to be derived from an interaction of the magnetic field with either the sun or the stars, with some evidence suggesting that sunset/sunrise provides the primary directional reference by which a magnetic compass is calibrated daily. We demonstrate that homing greater mouse-eared bats (Myotis myotis) calibrate a magnetic compass with sunset cues by testing their homing response after exposure to an altered magnetic field at and after sunset. Magnetic manipulation at sunset resulted in a counterclockwise shift in orientation compared with controls, consistent with sunset calibration of the magnetic field, whereas magnetic manipulation after sunset resulted in no change in orientation. Unlike in birds, however, the pattern of polarization was not necessary for the calibration. For animals that occupy ecological niches where the sunset is rarely observed, this is a surprising finding. Yet it may indicate the primacy of the sun as an absolute geographical reference not only for birds but also within other vertebrate taxa.",0.021369407,0.8522356,0.023534078,0.02511382,0.009214392,0.033808347,0.014394589,0.013184494,0.009261929,0.009594347,0.008105434,0.007792373,0.010877268,0.013298566,0.004401433,0.004638648,0.012485113,0.01006517,0.010032137,0.016169105,0.010169375,0.024958106,0.18751726,0.008397974,0.011619465,0.016512062,0.011599811,0.007499155,0.013098937,"['myotis myotis', 'mouse-eared bat', 'bird', 'birds', 'myotis', 'bats']","[0.0, 0.0, 0.054545454545454, 0.054545454545454, 0.018181818181818, 0.036363636363636]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.33333333333333304, 0.6666666666666661]"

Here, we tested the mourning cuttlefish, Sepia plangon, and the reaper cuttlefish, Sepia mestus, for polarization sensitivity using a large-field optomotor stimulus containing polarization contrast. Polaroid filter drums with stripes producing alternating e-vectors were rotated around free-moving animals. Polarized optomotor responses were displayed, and these responses were similar to those performed in response to a black-and-white, vertically-striped drum, whereas no responses were displayed to a plain polarizing control drum producing just a vertical e-vector. This indicates that the animals are able to see the contrast between adjacent stripes in the polarizing drum.

Following metagenomic studies on the consortium, a 90 kDa, multidomain cellulase, annotated as a member of the TIM barrel glycosyl hydrolase superfamily, was characterized. The multidomain architecture of this protein is uncommon for hyperthermophilic endoglucanases, and two of the four domains of the enzyme have no characterized homologues. The recombinant enzyme has optimal activity at 109 °C, a half-life of 5 h at 100 °C, and resists denaturation in strong detergents, high-salt concentrations, and ionic liquids.

Genicula are formed when calcified cells decalcify and restructure to create flexible tissue. The present study has identified important differences in the main agaran disaccharidic repeating units [→3)‐β‐d‐Galp (1→ 4)‐α‐l‐Galp(1→] synthesized by genicular and intergenicular segments. Based on chemical and spectroscopical analyses, we report that genicular cells from C. cheilosporioides biosynthesize a highly methoxylated galactan at C‐6 position with low levels of branching with xylose side stubs on C‐6 of the [→3)‐β‐d‐Galp (1→] units, whereas intergenicular segments produce xylogalactans with high levels of xylose and low levels of 6‐O‐methyl β‐d‐Gal units. These data suggest that, during genicular development, xylosyl branched, 3‐linked β‐d‐Galp units present in the xylogalactan backbones from intergenicular walls are mostly replaced by 6‐O‐methyl‐d‐galactose units. We speculate that this structural shift is a consequence of a putative and specific methoxyl transferase that blocks the xylosylation on C‐6 of the 3‐linked β‐d‐Galp units. Changes in galactan substitutions may contribute to the distinct mechanical properties of genicula and may lend insight into the calcification process in coralline algae.",0.01989909,0.018011574,0.028753176,0.007579254,0.8410417,0.013280959,0.85530156,0.025789721,0.014150244,0.015768124,0.012811139,0.006888663,0.021971768,0.014828179,0.017156227,0.05406795,0.043853775,0.012814662,0.013978037,0.013500752,0.049886964,0.01960727,0.026650503,0.018502709,0.031503163,0.038180787,0.03317987,0.017059777,0.022353915,['calliarthron cheilosporioides'],[0.012987012987012],[1.0]

We have shown that much of this behaviour can be attributed to a cocktail of six proteins, designated ranaspumins (Rsn-1 to Rsn-6), which predominate in the foam. These fall into two discernable classes based on sequence analysis and biophysical properties. Rsn-2, with an amphiphilic amino acid sequence unlike any hitherto reported, exhibits substantial detergent-like surfactant activity necessary for production of foam, yet is harmless to the membranes of eggs and spermatozoa. A further four (Rsn-3 to Rsn-6) are lectins, three of which are similar to fucolectins found in teleosts but not previously identified in a land vertebrate, though with a carbohydrate binding specificity different from previously described fucolectins. The sixth, Rsn-1, is structurally similar to proteinase inhibitors of the cystatin class, but does not itself appear to exhibit any such activity. The nest foam itself, however, does exhibit potent cystatin activity. Rsn-encoding genes are transcribed in many tissues of the adult frogs, but the full cocktail is present only in oviduct glands. Combinations of lectins and cystatins have known roles in plants and animals for defence against microbial colonization and insect attack.

In hydrostatic skeletons, force is transmitted not through rigid skeletal elements but instead by internal pressure. Functioning of these systems depends on the fact that they are essentially constant in volume as they consist of relatively incompressible fluids and tissue. Contraction of muscle and the resulting decrease in one of the dimensions thus results in an increase in another dimension. By actively (with muscle) or passively (with connective tissue) controlling the various dimensions, a wide array of deformations, movements and changes in stiffness can be created. An amazing range of animals and animal structures rely on this form of skeletal support, including anemones and other polyps, the extremely diverse wormlike invertebrates, the tube feet of echinoderms, mammalian and turtle penises, the feet of burrowing bivalves and snails, and the legs of spiders. In addition, there are structures such as the arms and tentacles of cephalopods, the tongue of mammals and the trunk of the elephant that also rely on hydrostatic skeletal support but lack the fluid-filled cavities that characterize this skeletal type.

However, there exists little systematic information for the full extent of intracanopy plasticity, whether it is linked with height and exposure, or its variation across species. For arboretum-grown trees of six temperate deciduous species averaging 13-18 m in height, we quantified intracanopy plasticity for 11 leaf traits across three canopy locations (basal-interior, basal-exterior, and top). Plasticity was pronounced across the canopy, and maximum likelihood analyses indicated that plasticity was primarily linked with irradiance, regardless of height. Intracanopy plasticity (the quotient of values for top and basal-interior leaves) was often similar across species and statistically indistinguishable across species for several key traits. At canopy tops, the area of individual leaves was on average 0.5-0.6 times that at basal-interior, stomatal density 1.1-1.5 times higher, sapwood cross-sectional area up to 1.7 times higher, and leaf mass per area 1.5-2.2 times higher; guard cell and stomatal pore lengths were invariant across the canopy. Species differed in intracanopy plasticity for the mass of individual leaves, leaf margin dissection, ratio of leaf to sapwood areas, and stomatal pore area per leaf area; plasticity quotients ranged only up to ≈2. Across the six species, trait plasticities were uncorrelated and independent of the magnitude of the canopy gradient in irradiance or height and of the species' light requirements for regeneration.

The large, water-filled stems of baobab trees (Adansonia spp.) are generally assumed to serve a water storage function, yet recent studies indicate limited use of stored water. Through an analysis of wood structure and composition, we examined whether baobab morphology reflects biomechanical constraints rather than water storage capacity in the six Madagascar baobab species. Baobab wood has a high water content (up to 79%), low wood density (0.09-0.17 g · cm(-3)), high parenchyma content (69-88%), and living cells beyond 35 cm into the xylem from the cambium. Volumetric construction cost of the wood is several times lower than in more typical trees, and the elastic modulus approaches that of parenchyma tissue. Safety factors calculated from estimated elastic buckling heights were low, indicating that baobabs are not more overbuilt than other temperate and tropical trees, yet the energy investment in stem material is comparable to that in temperate deciduous trees. Furthermore, the elastic modulus of the wood decreases with water content, such that excessive water withdrawal from the stem could affect mechanical stability.",0.48833433,0.002923391,0.019511739,0.003836008,0.057158053,0.00362007,0.007735783,0.007044104,0.006004436,0.009630614,0.00811287,0.006640442,0.003649607,0.005138109,0.007350028,0.027355256,0.002473602,0.00355336,0.013785578,0.007690391,0.006475854,0.003270265,0.006831974,0.00846904,0.007078242,0.00405371,0.005625353,0.009093562,0.006777177,['baobab'],[0.063291139240506],[1.0]

Despite the profound ecophysiological and taxonomic importance of this epidermal structure, the functions of nonabsorbent trichomes in remaining Bromeliaceae are not fully understood. The hypothesis that light reflection from these trichome layers provides photoprotection was not supported by spectroradiometry and fluorimetry in the present study; the mean reflectance of visible light from trichome layers did not exceed 6.4% on the adaxial surfaces of species representing a range of ecophysiological types nor was significant photoprotection provided by their presence. Several reports suggesting water repellency in some terrestrial Bromeliaceae were investigated. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and a new technique-fluorographic dimensional imaging (FDI)-were used to assess the interaction between aqueous droplets and the leaf surfaces of 86 species from 25 genera. In the majority of cases a dense layer of overlapping, stellate or peltate trichomes held water off the leaf epidermis proper. In the case of hydrophobic tank-forming tillandsioideae, a powdery epicuticular wax layer provided water repellency. The irregular architecture of these indumenta resulted in relatively little contact with water droplets. Most mesic terrestrial Pitcairnioideae examined either possessed glabrous leaf blades or hydrophobic layers of confluent trichomes on the abaxial surface. Thus, the present study indicates that an important ancestral function of the foliar trichome in Bromeliaceae was water repellency.

We used satellite and ground-based observations to study cloud and leaf wetting patterns in contrasting tropical montane and pre-montane cloud forests. We then studied the consequences of leaf wetting for the direct uptake of water accumulated on leaf surfaces into the leaves themselves. During the dry season, the montane forest experienced higher precipitation, cloud cover and leaf wetting events of longer duration than the pre-montane forest. Leaf wetting events resulted in foliar water uptake in all species studied.

The morphology of these scale hinges has not been studied. We used histological and SEM techniques to examine and compare the scale hinges of both species. Additional taxa in their respective lineages were examined in order to evaluate the potential that convergent evolution has occurred. In the two species that transport water, each scale hinge has a basally expanded and semi-enclosed channel formed by the hinge joint that is interconnected with all scale hinges on the body. We hypothesize that it is within this semi-tubular channel system of hinge joints, where the β-layer keratin of the integument is very thin, that water is transported. Hinge joint walls are covered by a complex topography of fractured surfaces that greatly expand the channel’s surface area and probably enhance capillary transport of water. In addition, we note differing morphology of scale surfaces at the rear of the jaws of both species. We hypothesize that capillary forces fill the scale-hinge system and additional forces, generated within the mouth by observed motions during drinking, depress local water-pressure to pull water through the channels of the hinge-joint system.

This uniform distribution of sap is indicated by the paths of vessels and tracheids, and has been proven experimentally by means of dyed sap injected into the base of stems or taken up by roots. Trees receiving water only from roots at one side of the root collar nevertheless stay green and continue growing. Spiral grain in bark distributes food from each branch to other flanks of the stem and to most roots. Experimental interruptions of the sap and food conduits caused the cambial zone to reorient new conduit cells in new directions, bypassing the interruption. In particular, spiral grooves cut into the stem surface caused spiral grain. The new cells reorient through division and growth. Although spiral grain is largely under genetic control, trees appear to have a spiral grain especially where needed for distribution of water when root spheres are dry at one side. Compared with straight-grained trees, spiral-grained stems and branches bend and twist more when exposed to strong wind, in this way offering less wind resistance and being less likely to break. Through the bending and twisting, snow slides down from branches rather than breaking them, but the main function of spiral grain is the uniform distribution of supplies from each root to all branches, and from each branch to many roots.",0.6597758,0.003267381,0.035519257,0.003804313,0.026447548,0.006446994,0.007065557,0.004050029,0.012598763,0.012130633,0.008227895,0.004270791,0.005335246,0.00560901,0.014034934,0.02261247,0.004084371,0.004945291,0.020492418,0.009886229,0.009627858,0.003295635,0.007290948,0.012267098,0.00527899,0.002881041,0.006524938,0.009889899,0.007495915,[],[],[]

Due to the extreme speeds of these strikes underwater, cavitation occurs between their appendages and hard-shelled prey. Here we examine the magnitude and relative contribution of the impact and cavitation forces generated by the peacock mantis shrimp Odontodactylus scyllarus. We present the surprising finding that each strike generates two brief, high-amplitude force peaks, typically 390–480 μs apart. Based on high-speed imaging, force measurements and acoustic analyses, it is evident that the first force peak is caused by the limb's impact and the second force peak is due to the collapse of cavitation bubbles. Peak limb impact forces range from 400 to 1501 N and peak cavitation forces reach 504 N. Despite their small size, O. scyllarus can generate impact forces thousands of times their body weight. Furthermore, on average, cavitation peak forces are 50% of the limb's impact force, although cavitation forces may exceed the limb impact forces by up to 280%. The rapid succession of high peak forces used by mantis shrimp suggests that mantis shrimp use a potent combination of cavitation forces and extraordinarily high impact forces to fracture shells.

Some mangrove species occupy the lower tidal zone in which the substrate is anoxic for long time periods while some mangroves inhabit the upper tidal zone in which the substrate should be less anoxic. Recent research has shown that about 12 species of mangroves from the Americas and from Australia transport air internally from openings in leaves called cork warts, as air enters leaves it collects within leaf aerenchyma (special air spaces within leaves) where the air expands when heated by sunlight. Aerenchyma in leaves is connected to aerenchyma in stems and stilt roots that lead to small roots in the substrate. Eventually, youngest root tissues are aerated while they grow within the anoxic substrate. Data of this study show that cork warts and leaf aerenchyma develop during leaf initiation in both shoot terminals of branches as well as in viviparous seedlings. The number of cork warts per leaf is similar for leaf primordia and for fully enlarged leaves for both Rhizophora species. Tissue sections of leaves of less than 30 mm2 area show an area of more translucent cells. Leaves with a surface area of 200 mm2 show a distinct aerenchyma tissue in which cells have no contents. For such leaves the depth of aerenchyma was 54 µm with a total leaf depth of 230 µm. Fully enlarged leaves had an aerenchyma depth of about 81 µm while the total leaf thickness was about 660 µm. For all leaves above 30 mm2, aerenchyma comprised 25% of total leaf volume. Densities of cork warts were the same for emerging leaf primordia as for fully enlarged leaves. The results of this study show that cork warts and aerenchyma develop in leaf primordia of both terminal buds and viviparous seedlings. Aerenchyma and cork warts become active once they emerge from their stipular coverings.",0.03162581,0.002330131,0.008273753,0.002747067,0.02404351,0.001783733,0.007187528,0.002790172,0.004158581,0.003751072,0.004210955,0.00156637,0.005924115,0.004345661,0.004091896,0.022337377,0.002254849,0.002254213,0.005272916,0.002312027,0.004285688,0.001570364,0.01149089,0.003747722,0.002701657,0.003608375,0.003225728,0.010934976,0.005603332,['plants'],[0.016393442622950002],[1.0]

Indeed, the long-held view that ocean sunfish are an inactive, passively drifting species seems to be entirely misplaced. Technological advances in marine telemetry are revealing distinct behavioural patterns and protracted seasonal movements. Extensive forays by ocean sunfish into the deep ocean have been documented and broad-scale surveys, together with molecular and laboratory based techniques, are addressing the connectivity and trophic role of these animals. These emerging molecular and movement studies suggest that local distinct populations may be prone to depletion through bycatch in commercial fisheries.

Previous studies have shown that macroalgae can easily withstand isolated impositions of maximal field forces. Nonetheless, macroalgae break frequently. Here we investigate the possibility that repeated loading by sub-lethal forces can eventually cause fracture by fatigue. We determine fracture toughness, in the form of critical strain energy release rate, for several flat-bladed macroalgae, thereby assessing their resistance to complete fracture in the presence of cracks. Critical energy release rates are evaluated through single-edge-notch, pull-to-break tests and single-edge-notch, repeated-loading tests. Crack growth at sub-critical energy release rates is measured in repeated-loading tests, providing a first assessment of algal breakage under conditions of repeated loading. We then estimate the number of imposed waves required for un-notched algal blades to reach the point of complete fracture. We find that, if not checked by repair, fatigue crack growth from repeated sub-lethal stresses may completely fracture individuals within days.

Bacterial abundance on the surface of D. pulchra, assessed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), was significantly lower than on the surfaces of 3 co-occurring algal species, all of which lack furanones. There was also a strong inverse correlation between bacterial abundance and furanone content (previously determined) for different sections of the thallus of D. pulchra, consistent with inhibition of bacteria by furanones. Based on these observations we experimentally investigated inhibition of marine bacteria by furanones, initially testing the effects of crude extract of D. pulchra (about 50% of which is furanones) on the growth of 144 strains of bacteria isolated from the surfaces of D. pulchra, nearby rocks, or a CO-occurring alga (Sargassum vestjtum) This crude extract did not strongly inhibit growth of these bacteria; 79% of the strains grew at 50 pg ml-' of crude extract, and 63 % grew at 500 pg ml-'. Inhibition of growth that did occur was strongly source dependent, with bacteria isolated from rocks the least affected, and strains from D. pulchra the most. As inhibition of growth did not provide an adequate explanation for the inverse relationship between levels of furanones and bacteria abundance on D. pulchra, we proceeded to investigate the effects of these metabolites on other bacterial characteristics relevant to colonisation-attachment, swarming, and swimming. lndividual furanones or crude extract at natural concentrations strongly inhibited bacterial attachment in the laboratory and in the field. In laboratory assays, attachment of 3 strains isolated from rocks was much more strongly affected than that of 3 isolates from D. pulchra, in contrast to the pattern for growth inhibition. We also tested individual furanones against swimming and swarming of the same 6 bacterial isolates (3 from rocks, 3 from D. pulchra) used in the attachment assays. At least some furanones inhibited swarming or sulmming at non-growth-inhibitory concentrations for all isolates, again indicating specific effects against bacterial characteristics. As for attachment, there were significant differences in the responses of different isolates to furanones. We also found that the ability to swarm was widespread among these surface associated marine bacteria, suggesting that swarming may be ecologically important in these systems. Overall, we found that the effects of furanones on bacteria varied among (1) furanones, (2) bacterial phenotypes, (3) different isolates and (4) different sources of isolation (e.g. rocks or algae). This differential inhibition of different bacterial isolates or phenotypes by furanones, as well as affecting overall bacterial abundance on the alga, should have strong effects on the species composition of the bacterial community on the alga's surface. The effects of furanones on specific bacterial colonisation traits are discussed in the light of recent evidence demonstrating that furanones interfere with bacterial acylated homoserine lactone regulatory systems.",0.007595252,0.007206884,0.005554203,0.00496909,0.010232851,0.006291577,0.00939776,0.005914127,0.008062922,0.008882926,0.010939959,0.009883327,0.011495951,0.006657207,0.006526261,0.010125406,0.007565711,0.007073501,0.00743935,0.007762262,0.011591706,0.008427911,0.008766985,0.008446434,0.008889712,0.93116516,0.006387231,0.010870509,0.006930423,[],[],[]

It grew at between 90°C and 113°C (optimum 106°C) and pH 4.0–6.5 (optimum 5.5) and 1%–4% salt (optimum 1.7%). The organism was a facultatively aerobic obligate chemolithoautotroph gaining energy by H2-oxidation. Nitrate, S2O32–, and low concentrations of O2 (up to 0.3% v/v) served as electron acceptors, yielding NH+4, H2S, and H2O as end products, respectively. Growth was inhibited by acetate, pyruvate, glucose, starch, or sulfur. The new isolate was able to form colonies on plates (at 102°C) and to grow at a pressure of 25000 kPa (250 bar). Exponentially growing cultures survived a one-hour autoclaving at 121°C. The GC content was 53mol%. The core lipids consisted of glycerol–dialkyl glycerol tetraethers and traces of 2,3-di-O-phytanyl-sn-glycerol. The cell wall was composed of a surface layer of tetrameric protein complexes arranged on a p4-lattice (center-to-center distance 18.5nm).

There is a considerable gap in the literature concerning the interaction of direct and diffuse light with leaves. Some understory plants have well-developed lens-shaped epidermal cells, which have long been thought to increase the absorption of diffuse light. To assess the role of epidermal cell shape in capturing direct vs. diffuse light, we measured leaf reflectance and transmittance with an integrating sphere system using leaves with flat (Begonia erythrophylla, Citrus reticulata, and Ficus benjamina) and lens-shaped epidermal cells (B. bowerae, Colocasia esculenta, and Impatiens velvetea). In all species examined, more light was absorbed when leaves were irradiated with direct as opposed to diffuse light. When leaves were irradiated with diffuse light, more light was transmitted and more was reflected in both leaf types, resulting in absorptance values 2-3% lower than in leaves irradiated with direct light. These data suggest that lens-shaped epidermal cells do not aid the capture of diffuse light.

Diffusivity of gases in water is approximately 10 000 times slower than in air; thus direct exchange of gases between submerged tissues and the environment is strongly impeded. Aerenchyma provides a low-resistance internal pathway for gas transport between shoot and root extremities. By this pathway, O2 is supplied to the roots and rhizosphere, while CO2, ethylene, and methane move from the soil to the shoots and atmosphere. Diffusion is the mechanism by which gases move within roots of all plant species, but significant pressurized through-flow occurs in stems and rhizomes of several emergent and floating-leaved wetland plants. Through-flows can raise O2 concentrations in the rhizomes close to ambient levels. In general, rates of flow are determined by plant characteristics such as capacity to generate positive pressures in shoot tissues, and resistance to flow in the aerenchyma, as well as environmental conditions affecting leaf-to-air gradients in humidity and temperature. O2 diffusion in roots is influenced by anatomical, morphological and physiological characteristics, and environmental conditions. Roots of many (but not all) wetland species contain large volumes of aerenchyma (e.g. root porosity can reach 55%), while a barrier impermeable to radial O2 loss (ROL) often occurs in basal zones. These traits act synergistically to enhance the amount of O2 diffusing to the root apex and enable the development of an aerobic rhizosphere around the root tip, which enhances root penetration into anaerobic substrates. The barrier to ROL in roots of some species is induced by growth in stagnant conditions, whereas it is constitutive in others. An inducible change in the resistance to O2 across the hypodermis/exodermis is hypothesized to be of adaptive significance to plants inhabiting transiently waterlogged soils. Knowledge on the anatomical basis of the barrier to ROL in various species is scant. Nevertheless, it has been suggested that the barrier may also impede influx of: (i) soil-derived gases, such as CO2, methane, and ethylene; (ii) potentially toxic substances (e.g. reduced metal ions) often present in waterlogged soils; and (iii) nutrients and water. Lateral roots, that remain permeable to O2, may be the main surface for exchange of substances between the roots and rhizosphere in wetland species. Further work is required to determine whether diversity in structure and function in roots of wetland species can be related to various niche habitats.",0.104519956,0.002767338,0.003574097,0.003998489,0.003860806,0.002084239,0.003398857,0.004312249,0.003365019,0.002760324,0.013727999,0.004274718,0.010363573,0.003581082,0.004225877,0.022671778,0.001714985,0.005402647,0.013586495,0.004093198,0.004489198,0.002235415,0.02824714,0.002964383,0.002810673,0.002956005,0.002073314,0.005711829,0.00494834,"['plants', 'vascular plants']","[0.022556390977443, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0]"

Flexibility allows fronds to `go with the flow', reconfiguring into streamlined shapes and reducing frond area projected into flow. This paradigm extends even to articulated coralline algae, which produce calcified fronds that are flexible only because they have distinct joints (genicula). The evolution of flexibility through genicula was a major event that allowed articulated coralline algae to grow elaborate erect fronds in wave-exposed habitats. Here we describe the mechanics of genicula in the articulated coralline Calliarthron and demonstrate how segmentation affects bending performance and amplifies bending stresses within genicula. A numerical model successfully predicted deflections of articulated fronds by assuming genicula to be assemblages of cables connecting adjacent calcified segments (intergenicula). By varying the dimensions of genicula in the model, we predicted the optimal genicular morphology that maximizes flexibility while minimizing stress amplification.

Little is known of electric signaling during courtship behavior because of two major difficulties: (1) the fish are not easily bred in captivity and (2) there is no reliable means of separating electric signals from several individuals in natural communication settings. Through simulating artificial rain conditions, we have successfully induced courtship and succeeded in breeding a mormyrid electric fish (Brienomyrus brachyistius) in the laboratory. We have also developed a system of video recording and editing combined with cross correlation analysis to precisely record and view behavior and separate EODs from two individuals in non-breeding and breeding contexts. Knowing the electrical and motor patterns during courtship allows for further exploration of topics such as mate choice and neural basis of pattern generation in these fish. Here we describe nine common motor displays and 11 SPIs. Analysis of frequency of occurrences suggests that some SPI patterns are sex and season specific. We also observed electrical duetting called `rasp matching' during courtship signaling among pairs; males and females exchange `rasps' and `bursts', respectively, in alternation.

Sacci are thought to help orient the pollen grain in the pollination droplet. Sacci also increase surface area of the pollen grain, yet add minimal mass, thereby increasing dispersal distance; however, this aerodynamic hypothesis has not been tested in a published study. Using scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy, mathematical modeling, and the saccate pollen of three extant conifers with structurally different pollen grains (Pinus, Falcatifolium, Dacrydium), we developed a computational model to investigate pollen flight. The model calculates terminal settling velocity based on structural characters of the pollen grain, including lengths, widths, and depths of the main body and sacci; angle of saccus rotation; and thicknesses of the saccus wall, endoreticulations, intine, and exine. The settling speeds predicted by the model were empirically validated by stroboscopic photography. This study is the first to quantitatively demonstrate the adaptive significance of sacci for the aerodynamics of wind pollination. Modeling pollen both with and without sacci indicated that sacci can reduce pollen settling speeds, thereby increasing dispersal distance, with the exception of pollen grains having robust endoreticulations and those with thick saccus walls. Furthermore, because the mathematical model is based on structural characters and error propagation methods show that the model yields valid results when sample sizes are small, the flight dynamics of fossil pollen can be investigated.

Bioelectroreduction of oxygen based on direct electron transfer between each of the two forms of Trametes pubescens laccase and spectrographic graphite electrodes has been demonstrated and studied. It is concluded that the T1 site of laccase is the first electron acceptor, both in solution (homogeneous case) and when the enzymes are adsorbed on the surface of the graphite electrode (heterogeneous case). Thus, the previously proposed mechanism of oxygen bioelectroreduction by adsorbed fungal laccase was additionally confirmed using two forms of the enzyme. Moreover, the assumed need for extracellular laccase to communicate directly and electronically with a solid matrix (lignin) in the course of lignin degradation is discussed.

physiological and genetical approaches. Rice plants secrete momilactones into the rhizosphere over their entire life cycle at phytotoxic levels, and momilactones are able to account for the majority of the observed rice allelopathy. However, allelopathic activities of momilactones were determined on only a few test plant species. Therefore, this study was to determine the allelopathic activities of momilactones against nine test plant species including weed species, and four rice cultivars. 
Momilactone A and B inhibited Arabidopsis, alfalfa, lettuce, cress, timothy, barnyard grass, E. colonum, crabgrass and ryegrass at concentrations greater than 3 and 0.3 μM, respectively. The inhibition on those test plants was concentration dependent. On the other hand, effectiveness of momilactone A and B on rice cultivars, Koshihikari, Nipponbare, Norin 8 and Sasanishiki was very weak. Those rice cultivars were only inhibited by momilactone A and B at concentrations greater than 300 and 100 μM, respectively. Momilactone A and B may have potential as templates for the development of new plant control substances because of their selective inhibitory activities on weed plant

We therefore quantified effects of simulated solar radiation and wind on metabolic heat production in the rock squirrel, Spermophilus variegatus. This diurnal mammal inhabits the Sonoran Desert and seasonally replaces its pelage in a fashion in which it retains constant external appearance but incorporates optical and structural changes that are thought to significantly alter heat-transfer properties of the coat. At a given wind speed, the presence of 950 W m⁻² of simulated solar radiation reduces metabolic heat production by 15% (at a wind speed of 4 m s⁻¹) to 37% (at a wind speed of 0.25 m s⁻¹). Independent of effects of irradiance, metabolic heat production significantly increases with wind speed such that as wind speed is increased from 0.25 m s⁻¹ to 4.0 m s⁻¹, metabolic heat production is elevated by 66% (sunlight absent) or 88% (sunlight present). Previous analyses demonstrated that when exposed to identical radiative and convective environments rock squirrels with summer pelages accrue solar heat loads 33%-71% lower than those experienced by animals with winter coats.

The labile nature of microtubules is critical for establishing cellular morphology and motility, yet the molecular basis of assembly remains unclear. Here we use optical tweezers to track microtubule polymerization against microfabricated barriers, permitting unprecedented spatial resolution.


RESULTS
We find that microtubules exhibit extensive nanometer-scale variability in growth rate and often undergo shortening excursions, in some cases exceeding five tubulin layers, during periods of overall net growth. This result indicates that the guanosine triphosphate (GTP) cap does not exist as a single layer as previously proposed. We also find that length increments (over 100 ms time intervals, n = 16,762) are small, 0.81 +/- 6.60 nm (mean +/- standard deviation), and very rarely exceed 16 nm (about two dimer lengths), indicating that assembly occurs almost exclusively via single-subunit addition rather than via oligomers as was recently suggested. Finally, the assembly rate depends only weakly on load, with the average growth rate decreasing only 2-fold as the force increases 7-fold from 0.4 pN to 2.8 pN.


CONCLUSIONS
The data are consistent with a mechanochemical model in which a spatially extended GTP cap allows substantial shortening on the nanoscale, while still preventing complete catastrophe in most cases.",0.01942166,0.017702015,0.25899193,0.016915103,0.021023436,0.26865143,0.023087824,0.046503246,0.94287,0.044944394,0.023327481,0.57198733,0.024863569,0.01645441,0.0425263,0.027635748,0.047031295,0.018723004,0.020350266,0.23766536,0.031917464,0.025833162,0.02324193,0.8478658,0.017056897,0.018270394,0.012277461,0.02727687,0.12883158,[],[],[]

It protects the fruit from splitting open and thus enables the contained seeds to stay germinable and to potentially be dispersed by animal vectors. The main part of the peel consists of a parenchymatous tissue that can be interpreted from a materials point of view as open pored foam whose struts are pressurized and filled with liquid. In order to investigate the influence of the water content on the energy dissipation capacity, drop weight tests were conducted with fresh and with freeze-dried peel samples. Based on the coefficient of restitution it was found that freeze-drying markedly reduces the relative energy dissipation capacity of the peel. Measuring the transmitted force during impact furthermore indicated a transition from a uniform collapse of the foam-like tissue to a progressive collapse due to water extraction. Representing the peel by a Maxwell model illustrates that freeze-drying not only drastically reduces the damping function of the dashpots but also stiffens the springs of the model.",0.019065693,0.026143955,0.014385277,0.019150656,0.07145001,0.023342354,0.019842498,0.009121555,0.009441729,0.022860924,0.020145286,0.014077015,0.026734402,0.02054954,0.014714532,0.015697608,0.023421096,0.018362477,0.016567685,0.0171687,0.02077731,0.01664853,0.025455441,0.019013237,0.90445775,0.020255212,0.8266878,0.056252025,0.019949457,"['citrus maxima', 'pomelo']","[0.0, 0.018867924528301]","[0.0, 1.0]"

Buller regarded certain cup-shaped reproductive bodies found among cryptogams as ""splash-cups"" which make use of the energy of raindrops for the dispersal of spores, sperms, and gemmae. Buller's concepts are presented and supplemented by investigations carried out since his death. Raindrops cause the peridioles of the Nidulariaceae or bird's-nest fungi to be thrown about four feet by splash action. In the genus Cyathus, as a peridiole is jerked out of its cup, the funiculus is torn and this makes possible the expansion of a mass of adhesive hyphae (the hapteron) which clings to any object in the line of flight. The momentum of the peridiole causes a long cord to be pulled out of a sheath attached to the peridiole. The peridiole is checked in flight and the jerk causes the funicular cord to become wound around stems or entangled among plant hairs. Thus the peridiole becomes attached to vegetation and may be eaten subsequently by herbivorous animals.

Given the expectation that males should compete vigorously for access to females, it may at first seem paradoxical that males in some species cooperate to reproduce, often resulting in the apparent sacrifice of direct fitness by some members of these cooperative partnerships. Because this form of cooperation lies at the interface between natural, sexual and kin selection, studies of the adaptive consequences of male reproductive cooperation may yield important insights into how complex and sometimes conflicting selective pressures shape individual behaviour. Here, we define and review examples of reproductive cooperation among male animals. We take an integrative approach to reviewing the potential causes of maleemale cooperation, including potential adaptive hypotheses, ecological correlates, phylogenetic patterns and physiological mechanisms. The impact of male reproductive cooperation on sexual selection theory is also discussed. We conclude by outlining several important directions for future research, including efforts to improve understanding of the ecological and demographic contexts in which male reproductive cooperation occurs. Collectively, such analyses promise to improve our understanding of multiple fundamental concepts in evolutionary biology. 2013 The Authors.

In the past, this has been accomplished using two-dimensional planar techniques that require reconstruction of three-dimensional flow patterns. We have applied a new, fully three-dimensional, volumetric imaging technique that allows instantaneous capture of wake flow patterns, to a classic problem in functional vertebrate biology: the function of the asymmetrical (heterocercal) tail of swimming sharks to capture the vorticity field within the volume swept by the tail. These data were used to test a previous three-dimensional reconstruction of the shark vortex wake estimated from two-dimensional flow analyses, and show that the volumetric approach reveals a different vortex wake not previously reconstructed from two-dimensional slices.

The flying feathers of birds are keratinous appendages designed for maximum performance with a minimum weight penalty. Thus, their design contains ingenious combinations of components that optimize lift, stiffness, aerodynamics, and damage resistance. This design involves two main parts: a central shaft that prescribes stiffness and lateral vanes which allows for the capture of air. Within the feather vane, barbs branch from the shaft and barbules branch from barbs, forming a flat surface which ensures lift. Microhooks at the end of barbules hold barbs tightly together, providing the close-knit, unified structure of the feather vane and enabling a repair of the structure through the reattachment of un-hooked junctions. Both the shaft and barbs are lightweight biological structures constructed of keratin using the common motif of a solid shell and cellular interior. The cellular core increases the resistance to buckling with little added weight. Here we analyze the detailed structure of the feather barb and, for the first time, explain its flexural stiffness in terms of the mechanics of asymmetric foam-filled beams subjected to bending. The results are correlated and validated with finite element modeling. We compare the flexure of single barbs as well as arrays of barbs and find that the interlocking adherence of barbs to one another enables a more robust structure due to minimized barb rotation during deflection. Thus, the flexure behavior of the feather vane can be tailored by the adhesive hooking between barbs, creating a system that mitigates damage. A simplified three-dimensional physical model for this interlocking mechanism is constructed by additive manufacturing. The exceptional architecture of the feather vane will motivate the design of bioinspired structures with tailored and unique properties ranging from adhesives to aerospace materials.


STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
Despite its importance to bird flight, literature characterizing the feather vane is extremely limited. The feather vane is composed of barbs that branch from the main shaft (rachis) and barbules that branch from barbs. In this study, the flexural behavior of the feather barb and the role of barbule connections in reinforcing the feather vane are quantitatively investigated for the first time, both experimentally and theoretically. Through the performed experiments, structure-function relationships within the feather vane are uncovered. Additionally, in the proposed model the sophisticated structure of the barbs and the interlocking mechanism of the feather vane are simplified to understand these processes in order to engineer new lightweight structures and adhesives.",0.025062045,0.020611653,0.04093025,0.014440332,0.7755441,0.03992841,0.6379193,0.026658135,0.02814143,0.011122732,0.01358652,0.010245222,0.027827585,0.033914596,0.024162062,0.038856562,0.8381948,0.017952275,0.025368882,0.022225797,0.056125514,0.023717113,0.045387596,0.025826978,0.027544115,0.043111645,0.022405472,0.010559787,0.06712569,"['bird', 'birds']","[0.0076335877862590005, 0.0076335877862590005]","[1.0, 1.0]"

Most probably a photomechanic IR sensillum acts as a microfluidic converter of infrared radiation which leads to an increase in internal pressure inside the sphere, which is measured by a mechanosensitive neuron. A simple model for this biological IR sensor is a modified Golay sensor in which the gas has been replaced by a liquid. Here, the absorbed IR radiation results in a pressure increase of the liquid and the deflection of a thin membrane.

Parasitoids of the pollinator were rare or absent outside the natural range of the mutualists, where the relative benefits the mutualists gained from their interaction were changed significantly away from the plant's natural range owing to reduced seed production rather than increased numbers of pollinator offspring. Furthermore, in the absence of the negative effects of its parasitoids, we detected an oviposition range expansion by the pollinator, with the use of a wider range of ovules that could otherwise have generated seeds.

They were found from the Ceriops tagal zone to the Rhizophora stylosa zone at elevations ranging from 7.22 to 5.99 meters above the lowest astronomical tide (LAT), which means that the nests were inundated in 13‐61% of all high tides and for durations of up to 3.5 hours. The nest structure was studied by excavating nests and making a cast of the galleries using polyurethane foam. The nests were quite extensive, normally with two elevated nest entrances and galleries down to depths of 45 cm. The loose soil particles at the nest entrances collapsed when the tide reached them and formed a stopper which prevented water from intruding into the nest. In this way, the galleries remained dry during high tide. The ants showed a clear swimming or ""walking on the surface"" behaviour when they returned to the nest just before the entrance collapsed and during ebb. The tolerance of the ants to submergence was tested in the laboratory, with 50% mortality after 11 hours submergence in seawater at 23 °C, and only 3.5 hours in water at 33 °C. Therefore, the nesting behaviour with trapped air in the galleries is necessary for survival in these environments.

The device grabs or releases a substrate in a fraction of a second via a low-voltage pulse that drives electroosmotic flow. Energy consumption is minimal because both the grabbed and released states are stable equilibria that persist with no energy added to the system. Notably, the device maintains the integrity of an array of hundreds to thousands of distinct interfaces during active reconfiguration from droplets to bridges and back, despite the natural tendency of the liquid toward coalescence. We demonstrate the scaling of adhesion strength with the inverse of liquid contact size.

While scanning the water for these hydrodynamic signals at a swimming speed in the order of meters per second, the seal keeps its long and flexible whiskers in an abducted position, largely perpendicular to the swimming direction. Remarkably, the whiskers of harbor seals possess a specialized undulated surface structure, the function of which was, up to now, unknown. Here, we show that this structure effectively changes the vortex street behind the whiskers and reduces the vibrations that would otherwise be induced by the shedding of vortices from the whiskers (vortex-induced vibrations). Using force measurements, flow measurements and numerical simulations, we find that the dynamic forces on harbor seal whiskers are, by at least an order of magnitude, lower than those on sea lion (Zalophus californianus) whiskers, which do not share the undulated structure. The results are discussed in the light of pinniped sensory biology and potential biomimetic applications.",0.034064155,0.021358658,0.024814123,0.021260552,0.035060853,0.95093375,0.016518662,0.010049257,0.057556123,0.024626581,0.02202476,0.010491828,0.020010646,0.022694752,0.015823886,0.007047956,0.30926836,0.01342775,0.00964819,0.25025094,0.013800905,0.027970906,0.0304215,0.033525467,0.018664127,0.018172197,0.01743781,0.008180297,0.023942271,"['phoca vitulina', 'zalophus californianus', 'fish', 'seals', 'harbor seal', 'lion', 'seal']","[0.0, 0.0, 0.014492753623188002, 0.043478260869565, 0.057971014492753006, 0.014492753623188002, 0.072463768115942]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.199999999999999, 0.6000000000000001, 0.799999999999999, 0.199999999999999, 1.0]"

The behavior involves: (1) raising the abdomen in an arch; (2) splaying and extending the legs; (3) dorso-ventral flattening and lateral spreading of the body; (4) lowering the head and tail; (5) opening and closing the jaws; and (6) drinking water collected on the dorsal body surface.

During light rainfall water flow to the jaws occurs within interscalar channels, but during heavy rainfall gravitational sheet flow may increase the amount of water arriving at the jaws. This integumental rain-harvesting system is similar to reported interscalar water transport in two agamid lizards, Moloch horridus and Phrynocephalus helioscopus.

Using high-speed video imaging, non-invasive microscopy techniques and a simple theoretical model, we show that the fast closure of the trap results from a snap-buckling instability, the onset of which is controlled actively by the plant.

Momilactone B inhibited the accumulation of subtilisin-like serine protease, amyrin synthase LUP2, β-glucosidase and malate synthase at 1 h after the momilactone application. Those proteins are involved in the metabolic turnover and the production of intermediates needed for cell structures resulting in plant growth and development. Momilactone B also inhibited the breakdown of cruciferin 2, which is essential for seed germination and seedling growth to construct cell structures. Momilactone B induced the accumulation of translationally controlled tumor protein, glutathione S-transferase and 1-cysteine peroxiredoxin 1. These proteins are involved in stress responses and increased stress tolerance. In addition, glutathione S-transferase has the activity of herbicide detoxification and 1-cysteine peroxiredoxin 1 has inhibitory activity for seed germination under unfavorable conditions.

Motivated by these experiments, we study the effect of catch bonding on unidirectional transport properties of cellular cargo carried by multiple dynein motors. We introduce a threshold force bond deformation (TFBD) model, consistent with the experiments, wherein catch bonding sets in beyond a critical applied load force. We find catch bonding can result in dramatic changes in the transport properties, which are in sharp contrast to kinesin-driven unidirectional transport, where catch bonding is absent. We predict that under certain conditions, the average velocity of the cellular cargo can actually increase as applied load is increased. We characterize the transport properties in terms of a velocity profile plot in the parameter space of the catch bond strength and the stall force of the motor.

This phase forms when charged macromolecules, including lubricin, superficial-zone protein, and aggrecan, cross the interface between the superficial zone and the synovial cavity as they are secreted into the synovium from within the bulk of the cartilage, and, in particular, the feasibility of such brush-like surface-phases is examined in some detail.

Several species are hypothesized to use a catapult-like mechanism to store and rapidly release elastic energy, producing power outputs far beyond the capability of muscle. Most evidence for this mechanism comes from measurements of whole-body power output; the decoupling of joint motion and muscle shortening expected in a catapult-like mechanism has not been demonstrated. We used high-speed marker-based biplanar X-ray cinefluoroscopy to quantify plantaris muscle fascicle strain and ankle joint motion in frogs in order to test for two hallmarks of a catapult mechanism: (i) shortening of fascicles prior to joint movement (during tendon stretch), and (ii) rapid joint movement during the jump without rapid muscle-shortening (during tendon recoil). During all jumps, muscle fascicles shortened by an average of 7.8 per cent (54% of total strain) prior to joint movement, stretching the tendon. The subsequent period of initial joint movement and high joint angular acceleration occurred with minimal muscle fascicle length change, consistent with the recoil of the elastic tendon. These data support the plantaris longus tendon as a site of elastic energy storage during frog jumping, and demonstrate that catapult mechanisms may be employed even in sub-maximal jumps.",0.017355567,0.010160398,0.07668039,0.008470469,0.026105462,0.03805862,0.024876729,0.016925653,0.019310575,0.02214866,0.005255084,0.011945515,0.01533263,0.024691883,0.02771177,0.013853964,0.39180645,0.008008596,0.00852964,0.013784944,0.031085432,0.016699597,0.012056108,0.08875151,0.013479666,0.013097815,0.012178153,0.007286028,0.88824826,['frogs'],[0.013157894736842],[1.0]

Like human-designed infrastructure systems, those of social insects are regularly subject to disruptions such as natural disasters, blockages or breaks in the transportation network, fluctuations in supply and/or demand, outbreaks of disease and loss of individuals. Unlike human-designed systems, there is no deliberate planning or centralized control system; rather, individual insects make simple decisions based on local information. How do these highly decentralized, leaderless systems deal with disruption? What factors make a social insect system resilient, and which factors lead to its collapse? In this review, we bring together literature on resilience in three key social insect infrastructure systems: transportation networks, supply chains and communication networks. We describe how systems differentially invest in three pathways to resilience: resistance, redirection or reconstruction.

The propulsive efficiency of the species is believed to be one of the highest measured for a thrust generating apparatus within the animal kingdom. The goals of this research were to understand the distinctive biological mechanisms that allow the beetles to swim and dive, while searching for potential bio-inspired robotics applications. Through static and dynamic measurements obtained using a combination of microscopy and high-speed imaging, parameters associated with the morphology and beating kinematics of the whirligig beetle's legs in swimming and diving were obtained. Using data obtained from these experiments, dynamics models of both swimming and diving were developed. Through analysis of simulations conducted using these models it was possible to determine several key principles associated with the swimming and diving processes. First, we determined that curved swimming trajectories were more energy efficient than linear trajectories, which explains why they are more often observed in nature. Second, we concluded that the hind legs were able to propel the beetle farther than the middle legs, and also that the hind legs were able to generate a larger angular velocity than the middle legs. However, analysis of circular swimming trajectories showed that the middle legs were important in maintaining stable trajectories, and thus were necessary for steering. Finally, we discovered that in order for the beetle to transition from swimming to diving, the legs must change the plane in which they beat, which provides the force required to alter the tilt angle of the body necessary to break the surface tension of water. We have further examined how the principles learned from this study may be applied to the design of bio-inspired swimming/diving robots.",0.0163596,0.016123338,0.049227692,0.017308779,0.041958053,0.77161115,0.011113253,0.015791407,0.9294304,0.026745278,0.024803009,0.02833651,0.016601468,0.00694761,0.023407679,0.01677921,0.020060865,0.01549104,0.010403856,0.05374051,0.019949563,0.014260791,0.037868157,0.03310761,0.011066758,0.019467873,0.017701998,0.013318691,0.024844473,"['beetles', 'coleoptera', 'whirligig beetles', 'gyrinidae']","[0.027027027027027, 0.013513513513513, 0.013513513513513, 0.013513513513513]","[1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]"

Information is available about the mechanical properties of cuticle-Young's modulus of resilin is about 1 MPa, of soft cuticles about 1 kPa to 50 MPa, of sclerotised cuticles 1-20 GPa; Vicker's Hardness of sclerotised cuticle ranges between 25 and 80 kgf mm(-2); density is 1-1.3 kg m(-3)-and one of its components, chitin nanofibres, the Young's modulus of which is more than 150 GPa. Experiments based on fracture mechanics have not been performed although the layered structure probably provides some toughening. The structural performance of wings and legs has been measured, but our understanding of the importance of buckling is lacking: it can stiffen the structure (by elastic postbuckling in wings, for example) or be a failure mode. We know nothing of fatigue properties (yet, for instance, the insect wing must undergo millions of cycles, flexing or buckling on each cycle). The remarkable mechanical performance and efficiency of cuticle can be analysed and compared with those of other materials using material property charts and material indices. Presented in this paper are four: Young's modulus-density (stiffness per unit weight), specific Young's modulus-specific strength (elastic hinges, elastic energy storage per unit weight), toughness-Young's modulus (fracture resistance under various loading conditions), and hardness (wear resistance). In conjunction with a structural analysis of cuticle these charts help to understand the relevance of microstructure (fibre orientation effects in tendons, joints and sense organs, for example) and shape (including surface structure) of this fibrous composite for a given function.

Two types of processes are involved: 1) clustering at diminishing spatial scales, which brings dispersed locusts together and which, in patchy micro-environments with a concentrated food resource, gives rise to nuclei of pheromone-emitting, gregarizing insects; and 2) recruitment processes which promote the horizontal spread of gregarious traits from such nuclei. Because of the heterogeneity of typical breeding habitats and divergent behavior of the 2 phases of the insect, there is a dynamic interplay between the forces of crowd formation and those of dispersal. All the key steps in the course of phase change are reversible and for successful development of a viable gregarious population, all must proceed at optimal pace toward the gregarious phase. The process resembles a chemical transformation that involves a series of reversible sequential steps and may, likewise, be treated as a series of equilibria. Such a conceptual model may constitute a useful framework for quantitative studies in desert locust primary breeding areas and in the development of a predictive gregarization model.",0.004692781,0.005953278,0.038362775,0.013281622,0.003961926,0.003369696,0.00374271,0.012253314,0.007749665,0.02149389,0.004626627,0.026311273,0.005745336,0.038714938,0.003657938,0.005256557,0.005206332,0.005554293,0.044143185,0.002023557,0.004198887,0.024327468,0.011174442,0.019920176,0.005938896,0.006742134,0.004465329,0.012020669,0.012606358,"['locusts', 'insects', 'desert locust']","[0.02127659574468, 0.02127659574468, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0]"

The most distinct molecular feature of defensins is cationicity, manifested by abundant Arg and/or Lys residues in their sequences. Sequence analysis indicates that Arg is strongly selected over Lys in α-defensins but not in β-defensins. To understand this Arg/Lys disparity in defensins, we chemically synthesized human α-defensin 1 (HNP1) and several HNP1 analogs where three Arg residues were replaced by each of the following six α-amino acids: Lys, ornithine (Orn), diaminobutyric acid (Dab), diaminopropionic acid (Dap), N,N-dimethyl-Lys (diMeLys), and homo-Arg (homoArg). In addition, we prepared human β-defensin 1 (hBD1) and Lys→ArghBD1 in which all four Lys residues were substituted for Arg. Bactericidal activity assays revealed the following. 1) Arg-containing HNP1 and Lys→ArghBD1 are functionally better than Lys-HNP1 and hBD1, respectively; the difference between Arg and Lys is more evident in the α-defensin than in the β-defensin and is more evident at low salt concentrations than at high salt concentrations. 2) For HNP1, the Arg/Lys disparity is much more pronounced with Staphylococcus aureus than with Escherichia coli, and the Arg-rich HNP1 kills bacteria faster than its Lys-rich analog. 3) Arg and Lys appear to have optimal chain lengths for bacterial killing as shortening Lys or lengthening Arg in HNP1 invariably becomes functionally deleterious.

We have investigated how these animals regulate brain temperature under heavy heat loads. Animals were instrumented for measurements of blood flow, tissue temperatures and respiratory frequency (f) under full anaesthesia, whereas measurements were also made in fully conscious animals while in a climatic chamber or running on a treadmill. At rest, brain temperature (Tbrain) rose from 38.5±0.1°C at 10°C to 39.5±0.2°C at 50°C, while f increased from ×7 to ×250 breaths min–1, with a change to open-mouth panting (OMP) at Tbrain 39.0±0.1°C, and carotid and sublingual arterial flows increased by 160% and 500%, respectively. OMP caused jugular venous and carotid arterial temperatures to drop, presumably owing to a much increased respiratory evaporative heat loss. Angular oculi vein (AOV) flow was negligible until Tbrain reached 38.9±0.1°C, but it increased to 0.81 ml min–1 kg–1 at Tbrain 39.2±0.2°C. Bilateral occlusion of both AOVs induced OMP and a rise in Tbrain and f at Tbrain >38.8°C. We propose that reindeer regulate body and, particularly, brain temperature under heavy heat loads by a combination of panting, at first through the nose, but later, when the heat load and the minute volume requirements increase due to exercise, primarily through the mouth and that they eventually resort to selective brain cooling.",0.00740721,0.015660098,0.008386288,0.004535397,0.011488357,0.014530676,0.009623581,0.007171383,0.011206423,0.007746559,0.010345425,0.006729906,0.007034425,0.00548425,0.004602349,0.01670797,0.007079243,0.008151914,0.006297319,0.009775611,0.010198036,0.0067837,0.9579316,0.004357214,0.010130866,0.008961682,0.00769941,0.009164191,0.014006834,"['reindeer', 'rangifer tarandus']","[0.021978021978021, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0]"

Several important factors and signaling pathways involved in lymphatic collecting vessel maturation and valve morphogenesis have now been discovered. The present review summarizes the current knowledge about the key steps of lymphatic collecting vessel development and maturation and focuses on the regulatory mechanisms involved in lymphatic valve formation.",0.8351837,0.017168025,0.020874852,0.016202636,0.01591028,0.019577615,0.021125015,0.008198744,0.006617568,0.024155378,0.033424355,0.046225138,0.017816417,0.03681845,0.01612762,0.03474852,0.01835898,0.022130752,0.038628872,0.044973295,0.018918961,0.020711891,0.013016746,0.018633822,0.015910968,0.8504127,0.011639212,0.034330286,0.023348987,[],[],[]

However, some plants could adopt some strategies to resist salinity and drought stresses. Among these strategies, the mechanism of osmotic adjustment could help plants and algae to avoid ion toxicity and maintain water uptake in both stresses by accumulating large quantities of osmolytes. Two types of osmolytes, organic solutes and inorganic ions, play a key role in osmotic adjustment. Different osmolytes and their osmotic adjustment actions are different according to their distribution in different plants. Organic solutes, known as compatible solutes, include amino acids, glycerol, sugars, and other low molecular weight metabolites, serve a function in cells to lower or balance the osmotic potential of intracellular and extracellular ions in resistance to osmotic stresses. Inorganic ions for osmotic adjustment are mainly Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Cl–.

However, the specialized mutualistic mirid bug Pameridea roridulae lives and walks on this sticky plant surface without being trapped. We have sought to reveal the mechanism underlying the apparent non-sticky nature of the cuticle of this bug. In this study, we have visualized intact plant and insect surfaces using cryo-scanning electron microscopy and measured the adhesive properties of the plant secretion on different surfaces. We present a combination of structural and experimental results that suggest that a thick and cohesively weak film of an outermost, epicuticular greasy secretion acts as a `sloughing-off' layer, preventing the formation of contacts between the sticky plant secretion and the solid insect cuticle. In a comparative study of fresh cuticle fractures of flies representing a typical prey of R. gorgonias, a thin, fragmentary layer of epicuticular grease was revealed. These results indicate that, when trapping prey, the plant adhesive might form proper contact with solid islands of the insect cuticle that are free of epicuticular grease.",0.02591933,0.013330747,0.018346867,0.01828772,0.03074604,0.016290393,0.011915899,0.023311855,0.023295097,0.9086286,0.012118845,0.027240353,0.019897217,0.01892401,0.89521104,0.01736991,0.014013862,0.014009494,0.01876503,0.012633244,0.011073977,0.012279751,0.009697783,0.06867183,0.018358052,0.033886876,0.02108429,0.022671102,0.029407885,"['insects', 'roridula gorgonias', 'flies']","[0.017241379310344, 0.0, 0.017241379310344]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0]"

Histological methods, based on embedding in both paraffin and glycol methacrylate, were used to document the arrangement of muscle and connective tissue. The tube foot wall includes longitudinal muscles and connective tissue fibers, the latter arranged in a crossed-fiber helical array, with a fiber angle of about 67{deg} in elongated tube feet. No evidence was found for the circular rings of connective tissue reported in earlier studies; the appearance of rings is probably an artifact of folding. The ampullae are bilobed and include circumferentially arranged muscle fibers and connective tissue fibers aligned 90{deg} to the muscle. The lateral canals are short and equipped with oneway flap valves similar to those described for other echinoderms. The radial canal is thin-walled, nonmuscular, and enclosed in the connective tissue and ossicles of the ambulacrum. Frame-by-frame video analysis of both intact animals and animals with ""windows"" cut in the arm wall was used to document the movements of the tube feet and ampullae. No evidence was found for the previously suggested role of the radial canal in protracting the tube feet. The ampullae protract the tube feet and antagonize the tube foot musculature.

To understand how the tick achieves both tasks, penetration and attachment, with the same set of implements, we recorded the insertion events by cinematography, interpreted the mouthparts’ function by scanning electron microscopy and identified their points of articulation by confocal microscopy. Our structural dynamic observations suggest that the process of insertion and attachment occurs via a ratchet-like mechanism with two distinct stages. Initially, the two telescoping chelicerae pierce the skin and, by moving alternately, generate a toehold. Subsequently, a breaststroke-like motion, effected by simultaneous flexure and retraction of both chelicerae, pulls in the barbed hypostome. This combination of a flexible, dynamic mechanical ratchet and a static holdfast thus allows the tick to solve the problem of how to penetrate skin and also remain stuck for long periods of time.",0.011458563,0.005083209,0.008593485,0.004772116,0.01334208,0.004328139,0.007086721,0.00477512,0.019644003,0.10655483,0.00275013,0.004180498,0.006637355,0.00474472,0.25748593,0.014448912,0.005526109,0.004939452,0.00609236,0.004620395,0.006004253,0.006768805,0.004728867,0.0104472,0.002778973,0.006941513,0.005933712,0.006693539,0.0662751,['ixodes ricinus'],[0.0],[0]

It usually functions for 70 yr without failure, and works so efficiently that very little blood is regurgitated at each pulse. In order to support this large pressure difference, the cusps must close simultaneously in all operating conditions and should not touch the wall of the aorta, for considerable reversed flow would then be required to close the valve. This action suggests a fluid dynamic control mechanism which positions the cusps away from the wall of the aorta, so that the slightest reversed flow will close the valve.",0.9393105,0.008830711,0.017391164,0.01319008,0.009589333,0.012555238,0.006330812,0.004269957,0.0039914,0.014640234,0.012808137,0.011165242,0.010314767,0.014170427,0.007063441,0.008971419,0.006121513,0.012458704,0.023351476,0.01926658,0.01025953,0.007892384,0.0119693,0.007074576,0.008121174,0.008961719,0.005688746,0.01002142,0.013059348,[],[],[]

In this paper, we show that the animal uses the motions of its valves to locally fluidize the surrounding soil and reduce burrowing drag. Substrate deformations were measured using particle image velocimetry (PIV) in a novel visualization system that enabled us to see through the soil and watch E. directus burrow in situ. PIV data, supported by soil and fluid mechanics theory, show that contraction of the valves of E. directus locally fluidizes the surrounding soil. Particle and fluid mixtures can be modeled as a Newtonian fluid with an effective viscosity based on the local void fraction. Using these models, we demonstrate that E. directus is strong enough to reach full burrow depth in fluidized soil, but not in static soil. Furthermore, we show that the method of localized fluidization reduces the amount of energy required to reach burrow depth by an order of magnitude compared with penetrating static soil, and leads to a burrowing energy that scales linearly with depth rather than with depth squared.",0.002542856,0.004336568,0.013020074,0.003192011,0.004745103,0.007339369,0.005396387,0.007774171,0.055559937,0.016252764,0.004157768,0.005727343,0.010541776,0.003428888,0.13218266,0.006198448,0.003868786,0.003359647,0.007910924,0.009108269,0.013190278,0.004812399,0.008610858,0.017043112,0.00361484,0.005854069,0.00233169,0.006735671,0.005903964,"['razor clams', 'ensis directus']","[0.0, 0.015384615384615]","[0.0, 1.0]"

Once a threshold signal concentration is reached, and therefore a certain number of bacteria have assembled, bacteria use QS to change gene expression levels and initiate behaviors that benefit the group. These group processes play central roles in both bacterial virulence and symbiosis and can have significant impacts on human health, agriculture, and the environment. The dependence of QS on small molecule signals has inspired organic chemists to design non-native molecules that can intercept these signals and thereby perturb bacterial group behaviors. The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been the target of many of these efforts due to its prevalence in human infections. P. aeruginosa uses at least two N-acyl l-homoserine lactone signals and three homologous LuxR-type receptors to initiate a range of pathogenic behaviors at high cell densities, including biofilm formation and the production of an arsenal of virulence factors. This perspective highlights recent chemical efforts to modulate LuxR-type receptor activity in P. aeruginosa and offers insight into the development of receptor-specific ligands as potential antivirulence strategies.",0.010816541,0.013183328,0.004740498,0.019594101,0.010620763,0.005689402,0.008052647,0.006964178,0.006421735,0.015031125,0.011742061,0.011484653,0.011621179,0.038597394,0.008617185,0.007640134,0.011261942,0.009485463,0.010893631,0.007330255,0.008306169,0.046517752,0.00618832,0.008954579,0.009535326,0.90369105,0.007477636,0.010424013,0.005765115,"['bacteria', 'pseudomonas aeruginosa']","[0.054545454545454, 0.018181818181818]","[1.0, 0.33333333333333304]"

Structural color is a special one, which is the color produced by micro- or nano-structures, and is bright and dazzling. The most common mechanisms of structural colors are film interference, diffraction grating, scattering and photonic crystals. Biological colors are mainly derived from film interference, which includes thin-film and multi-film interference. The diffraction grating mechanism is found in, for example, seed shrimp, mollusk Haliotis Glabra and the Hibiscus trionum flower. Scattering includes coherent and incoherent scattering. Well-known examples of coherent scattering include colors produced by brilliant iridescent butterfly wing scales and avian feather barbules, such as the peacock's tail. Examples of colors produced by photonic crystal structures include opal in beetles and iridescent spines in the sea mouse. Coloration changes occur through structural changes for camouflage, predation, signal communication and sex choice. This paper presents an overview of lessons from nature and various relevant mechanisms. Examples of bioinspired fabrication methods and applications are also presented in this paper.",0.014681945,0.015550597,0.006295466,0.00776148,0.018669719,0.010237484,0.005519939,0.014066516,0.015374066,0.022660548,0.009700095,0.010956734,0.017191116,0.01050496,0.013083536,0.007751612,0.009352165,0.8911784,0.011971376,0.017662069,0.016345471,0.011740649,0.012226962,0.015575962,0.013706233,0.014683504,0.013227768,0.016716778,0.009656559,"['banana', 'musa textilis']","[0.032786885245901, 0.016393442622950002]","[1.0, 0.5]"

This study examined how the petioles manage to achieve adequate rigidity to do this, while allowing extensive and reversible reconfiguration in high winds. Morphological and anatomical examination of the petioles and leaves of Musa textilis suggested how these two apparently incompatible abilities are achieved. The hollow U-shaped section of the petiole and the longitudinal strengthening elements in its outer skin give it adequate rigidity, while its ventral curvature help support the leaf without the need for thick lateral veins. These features, however, also allow the petiole to reconfigure by twisting away from the wind, while the leaf can fold away. In addition, two sets of internal structures, longitudinal partitions and transverse stellate parenchyma plates, help prevent dorsoventral flattening, allowing the petiole to flex further away from the wind without buckling. These ideas were tested and verified by a range of mechanical tests. Simple four-point-bending and torsion tests showed that the petioles are indeed far more compliant in torsion than in bending. Axial bending tests and crushing tests showed that petioles could be flexed twice as far and were four times as resistant to dorsoventral flattening when intact than when the internal tissue is removed.

The studies were performed as a basis for further evaluation of m-tyrosine activity in field soils containing living plant roots. Here, we examined the role of common soil amendments, including ammonium nitrate fertilizer and activated carbon, in overcoming plant growth inhibition in soils in a laboratory setting by using lettuce as a sensitive indicator of plant toxicity. The phytotoxicity of m-tyrosine was not influenced significantly by soil N amendment; however, when significant amounts of activated carbon were added to the soil medium, growth inhibition in treated lettuce seedlings was strongly reduced. Soil texture did not influence the bioavailability or activity of m-tyrosine, as activity in high organic growth media was similar to that of sand and soil mixtures. Similar to other purported allelochemicals, soil persistence of m-tyrosine was limited, with a predicted half life of less than 1 day in soil in a controlled laboratory setting. Rapid degradation of this molecule likely was due to microbial activity but degradation did not appear to be influenced significantly by soil N amendment.

Marine mussels attach themselves to rocky seashores using a series of byssal threads. Despite the constant rubbing caused by the motion of the tides, the threads show high wear resistance. Harrington et al. (p. 216, published online 4 March; see the Perspective by Messersmith) now find that the threads are protected by a proteinaceous outer cuticle that is rich in the amino acid 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa), which is known to be a strong adhesive. The cuticle is also rich in metal ions, primarily Fe3+. The dopa-metal crosslinks helped to form the tough outer coating. Marine mussel byssal threads have an outer coating in which proteins are linked to metal ions. The extensible byssal threads of marine mussels are shielded from abrasion in wave-swept habitats by an outer cuticle that is largely proteinaceous and approximately fivefold harder than the thread core. Threads from several species exhibit granular cuticles containing a protein that is rich in the catecholic amino acid 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa) as well as inorganic ions, notably Fe3+. Granular cuticles exhibit a remarkable combination of high hardness and high extensibility. We explored byssus cuticle chemistry by means of in situ resonance Raman spectroscopy and demonstrated that the cuticle is a polymeric scaffold stabilized by catecholato-iron chelate complexes having an unusual clustered distribution.

In return, the inhabiting ants protect plants against herbivores and sometimes provide them with nutrients. Here, we review recent advances in ant-plant symbioses, focusing on three areas. First, the nutritional ecology of plant-ants, which is based not only on plant-derived food rewards, but also on inputs from other symbiotic partners, in particular fungi and possibly bacteria. Food and protection are the most important 'currencies' exchanged between partners and they drive the nature and evolution of the relationships. Secondly, studies of conflict and cooperation in ant-plant symbioses have contributed key insights into the evolution and maintenance of mutualism, particularly how partner-mediated feedbacks affect the specificity and stability of mutualisms. There is little evidence that mutualistic ants or plants are under selection to cheat, but the costs and benefits of ant-plant interactions do vary with environmental factors, making them vulnerable to natural or anthropogenic environmental change.

As our understanding of these metabolites is still limited, we assessed the potential of such compounds against human-relevant fungi such as Aspergillus. In this work we isolated 201 bacterial strains from fifteen samples belonging to seven frog species collected in the highlands of Panama and tested them against Aspergillus fumigatus. Among the 29 bacterial isolates that exhibited antifungal activity, Pseudomonas cichorii showed the greatest inhibition. To visualize the distribution of compounds and identify them in the inhibition zone produced by P. cichorii, we employed MALDI imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI IMS) and MS/MS molecular networking. We identified viscosin and massetolides A, F, G and H in the inhibition zone. Furthermore, viscosin was isolated and evaluated in vitro against A. fumigatus and B. dendrobatidis showing MIC values of 62.50 µg/mL and 31.25 µg/mL, respectively.

This raises the question of why subordinates (betas) cooperate. Three nonexclusive hypotheses explain the adaptive basis of helping behavior by subordinate males: cooperation may increase (1) subordinates’ immediate reproductive success, (2) the reproductive success of close relatives, or (3) subordinates’ chances of future reproduction. I demonstrated that beta males rarely sired chicks and were unrelated to their alpha partners but received delayed direct benefits from cooperation; betas had an increased probability of becoming an alpha when compared to males that had not been betas. To investigate the mechanism by which betas attain these adaptive benefits, I examined betas’ success in replacing their alpha partners both in natural turnover events and when alphas were experimentally removed. Beta males did not consistently inherit alpha roles in the same territories where they served their beta tenure, arguing that queuing for status does not fully explain the benefits of cooperation for betas. Instead, betas may be apprenticing to develop effective and appropriate displays that enhance their subsequent success as alphas.

Small groups of foragers were monitored from time of orientation flights to time of death and all in-hive behaviors relating to foraging were recorded. In the context of a novice forager finding her first food source, 60% of the bees relied, at least in part, on acquiring information from waggle dances (being recruited) rather than searching independently (scouting). In the context of an experienced forager whose foraging has been interrupted, 37% of the time the bees resumed foraging by following waggle dances (being reactivated) rather than examining the food source on their own (inspecting). And in the context of an experienced forager engaged in foraging, 17% of the time the bees initiated a foraging trip by following a waggle dance. Such dance following was observed much more often after an unsuccessful than after a successful foraging trip. Successful foragers often followed dances just briefly, perhaps to confirm that the kind of flowers they had been visiting were still yielding forage. Overall, waggle dance following for food discovery accounted for 12–25% of all interactions with dancers (9% by novice foragers and 3–16% by experienced foragers) whereas dance following for reactivation and confirmation accounted for the other 75–88% (26% for reactivation and 49–62% for confirmation). We conclude that foragers make extensive use of the waggle dance not only to start work at new, unfamiliar food sources but also to resume work at old, familiar food sources.",0.006096066,0.004071247,0.010865368,0.031268846,0.002354133,0.002371204,0.002000386,0.007418486,0.011089811,0.02598621,0.002273693,0.008723532,0.006237369,0.064237036,0.005369379,0.004002247,0.005129218,0.006801155,0.00636649,0.003177772,0.001775406,0.041291587,0.004175152,0.008173506,0.003777941,0.004829218,0.00180539,0.004909061,0.008355071,[],[],[]

These birds travel thousands of kilometres to forage on ephemeral prey patches at variable locations, yet they can quickly and efficiently find their way back to their nests on remote islands to provision chicks, even with magnetic senses experimentally disrupted. Over the seemingly featureless ocean environment, local emissions of scents released by phytoplankton reflect bathymetric features such as shelf breaks and seamounts. These features suggest an odour landscape that may provide birds with orientation cues. We have previously shown that concentrated experimental deployments of one such compound, dimethyl sulphide (DMS), attracts procellariiforms at sea, suggesting that some species can use it as a foraging cue. Here we present the first physiological demonstration that an Antarctic seabird can detect DMS at biogenic levels.

Sturgeons search through the substrate with their electroreceptive rostrum, and engulf prey by oral suction [2]. Here, we show that juvenile freshwater sawfish Pristis microdon are active predators that use their toothed rostrum — the saw — to both sense prey-simulating electric fields and capture prey.

Thus it may often be advantageous for spiders to adjust web-building behaviour in response to variation in these environmental conditions. This hypothesis was examined in a study of the construction of webs and web decorations (conspicuous strands of silk at the hub of the web) of the orb-web spider Argiope keyserlingi. Web decorations are thought to have one or more separate functions. They may attract prey, deter predators or advertise the web to oncoming birds, thus preventing web damage. In this series of experiments, relationships between weather parameters and the construction of webs and web decorations were considered. In complementary laboratory experiments, A. keyserlingi spiders were exposed to two different light levels (700 and 90 lx), background contrasts (black and white) and temperature conditions (20 and 26°C). Of the available weather parameters, only temperature was significantly related to web decorating behaviour but not to web size. In the laboratory, temperature also influenced web-decorating behaviour, and spiders in dim light (700 lx) constructed larger webs and longer decorations. Background contrast did not significantly alter web size or web decorations. These data suggest that when prey availability is reduced at low temperatures, spiders may use web decorations to attract prey to the web. Similarly, in dim light, spiders may build more and larger decorations to increase the visual signal to approaching prey or to advertise the web to oncoming birds.",0.016745199,0.011874547,0.07307269,0.01131553,0.013055612,0.017476005,0.009757524,0.035422433,0.02941132,0.023402965,0.011827925,0.023348855,0.013779026,0.01801677,0.019830324,0.01631529,0.015312141,0.30432588,0.009957033,0.024417263,0.011143892,0.022753477,0.007846043,0.85580957,0.019436013,0.01045554,0.009806965,0.016795078,0.018632066,"['lepidoptera', 'moths', 'papilio', 'butterflies', 'papilio zalmoxis']","[0.047619047619047006, 0.015873015873015, 0.015873015873015, 0.015873015873015, 0.015873015873015]","[1.0, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304]"

We used fibre optic spectrophotometry, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and 2D Fourier analysis to investigate the physical mechanisms of structural colour production in twelve lepidopteran species from four families, representing all of the previously proposed anatomical and optical classes of butterfly nanostructure. The 2D Fourier analyses of TEMs of colour producing butterfly scales document that all species are appropriately nanostructured to produce visible colours by coherent scattering, i.e. differential interference and reinforcement of scattered, visible wavelengths. Previously hypothesized to produce a blue colour by incoherent, Tyndall scattering, the scales of Papilio zalmoxis are not appropriately nanostructured for incoherent scattering. Rather, available data indicate that the blue of P. zalmoxis is a fluorescent pigmentary colour. Despite their nanoscale anatomical diversity, all structurally coloured butterfly scales share a single fundamental physical color production mechanism - coherent scattering. Recognition of this commonality provides a new perspective on how the nanostructure and optical properties of structurally coloured butterfly scales evolved and diversified among and within lepidopteran clades.",0.016261954,0.012971643,0.00718943,0.007582069,0.015739067,0.009950399,0.005848649,0.01122682,0.014336303,0.02102582,0.008976962,0.009487156,0.01607208,0.011127001,0.009934008,0.008536086,0.00964823,0.8866003,0.012898241,0.018658776,0.016419189,0.0131332,0.013857059,0.015190589,0.01342434,0.013458611,0.012083343,0.014537103,0.010023895,[],[],[]

119,10.1038/NATURE06062,['Nature'],https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06062,Raptorial jaws in the throat help moray eels swallow large prey,"Most bony fishes rely on suction mechanisms to capture and transport prey. Once captured, prey are carried by water movement inside the oral cavity to a second set of jaws in the throat, the pharyngeal jaws, which manipulate the prey and assist in swallowing. Moray eels display much less effective suction-feeding abilities. Given this reduction in a feeding mechanism that is widespread and highly conserved in aquatic vertebrates, it is not known how moray eels swallow large fish and cephalopods. Here we show that the moray eel (Muraena retifera) overcomes reduced suction capacity by launching raptorial pharyngeal jaws out of its throat and into its oral cavity, where the jaws grasp the struggling prey animal and transport it back to the throat and into the oesophagus. This is the first described case of a vertebrate using a second set of jaws to both restrain and transport prey, and is the only alternative to the hydraulic prey transport reported in teleost fishes. The extreme mobility of the moray pharyngeal jaws is made possible by elongation of the muscles that control the jaws, coupled with reduction of adjacent gill-arch structures. The discovery that pharyngeal jaws can reach up from behind the skull to grasp prey in the oral jaws reveals a major innovation that may have contributed to the success of moray eels as apex predators hunting within the complex matrix of coral reefs.

Historically, in Eastern Europe, bed bugs were entrapped by leaves from bean plants, which were then destroyed; this purely physical entrapment was related to microscopic hooked hairs (trichomes) on the leaf surfaces. Using scanning electron microscopy and videography, we documented the capture mechanism: the physical impaling of bed bug feet (tarsi) by these trichomes. This is distinct from a Velcro-like mechanism of non-piercing entanglement, which only momentarily holds the bug without sustained capture. Struggling, trapped bed bugs are impaled by trichomes on several legs and are unable to free themselves. Only specific, mechanically vulnerable locations on the bug tarsi are pierced by the trichomes, which are located at effective heights and orientations for bed bug entrapment despite a lack of any evolutionary association. Using bean leaves as templates, we microfabricated surfaces indistinguishable in geometry from the real leaves, including the trichomes, using polymers with material properties similar to plant cell walls. These synthetic surfaces snag the bed bugs temporarily but do not hinder their locomotion as effectively as real leaves.",0.005506944,0.003056332,0.010734682,0.0040855,0.013358171,0.005558055,0.003257713,0.00809757,0.028781282,0.13124374,0.002858415,0.002943914,0.007319057,0.007364428,0.1236091,0.003777478,0.004708516,0.004536155,0.012847132,0.006719322,0.006789823,0.001851765,0.002665792,0.027742151,0.003408771,0.004576516,0.023040505,0.018990176,0.03622724,[],[],[]

This, in turn, has served as a driving force for the discovery and application of novel biosurfactants. The class Actinobacteria represents a vast group of microorganisms with the ability to produce a diverse range of secondary metabolites, including surfactants. Understanding the extensive nature of the biosurfactants produced by actinobacterial strains can assist in finding novel biosurfactants with new potential applications. This review therefore presents a comprehensive overview of the knowledge available on actinobacterial surfactants, the chemical structures that have been completely or partly elucidated, as well as the identity of the biosurfactant-producing strains. Producer strains of not yet elucidated compounds are discussed, as well as the original habitats of all the producer strains, which seems to indicate that biosurfactant production is environmentally driven. Methodology applied in the isolation, purification and structural elucidation of the different types of surface active compounds, as well as surfactant activity tests, are also discussed. Overall, actinobacterial surfactants can be summarized to include the dominantly occurring trehalose-comprising surfactants, other non-trehalose containing glycolipids, lipopeptides and the more rare actinobacterial surfactants. The lack of structural information on a large proportion of actinobacterial surfactants should be considered as a driving force to further explore the abundance and diversity of these compounds.

The potential for water transfer by such networks was examined by manipulating CMNs independently of plant roots in order to isolate the role(s) of ectomycorrhizal (EM) and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) networks in the plant water balance during drought (soil water potential -5.9 MPa). Fluorescent tracer dyes and deuterium-enriched water were used to follow the pathways of water transfer from coastal live oak seedlings (Quercus agrifolia Nee; colonized by EM and AMF) conducting hydraulic lift (HL) into the roots of water-stressed seedlings connected only by EM (Q. agrifolia) or AMF networks (Q. agrifolia, Eriogonum fasciculatum Benth., Salvia mellifera Greene, Keckiella antirrhinoides Benth). When connected to donor plants by hyphal linkages, deuterium was detected in the transpiration flux of receiver oak plants, and dye-labelled extraradical hyphae, rhizomorphs, mantles, and Hartig nets were observed in receiver EM oak roots, and in AMF hyphae of Salvia. Hyphal labelling was scarce in Eriogonum and Keckiella since these species are less dependent on AMF. The observed patterns of dye distribution also indicated that only a small percentage of mycorrhizal roots and extraradical hyphae were involved with water transfer among plants. Our results suggest that the movement of water by CMNs is potentially important to plant survival during drought, and that the functional ecophysiological traits of individual mycorrhizal fungi may be a component of this mechanism.",0.8916093,0.006407985,0.012685234,0.009449215,0.006961158,0.007699246,0.005787595,0.003510789,0.003021988,0.011532318,0.009780712,0.007914709,0.008695862,0.013152248,0.007557077,0.010265864,0.004747018,0.008790324,0.017917672,0.015672356,0.007540519,0.006385607,0.01346611,0.006552413,0.007507781,0.005572884,0.005687652,0.008361687,0.011037618,['sea urchin'],[0.0],[0]

Whole skeletons without ligaments (removed by bleaching) broke at lower apically applied forces than did intact, fresh skeletons. In addition, in three-point bending tests on excised plate combinations, sutural ligaments strengthened sutures but not plates. The degree of sutural strengthening by ligaments depended on sutural position; in tensile tests, ambital and adapical sutures were strengthened more than adoral sutures. Adapical sutures, which grow fastest, were also the loosest, suggesting that strengthening by ligaments is associated with growth. In fed, growing urchins, sutures overall were looser than in unfed urchins. Looseness was demonstrated visually and by vibration analysis: bleached skeletons of unfed urchins rang at characteristic frequencies, indicating that sound traveled across tightly fitting sutures; skeletons of fed urchins damped vibrations, indicating loss of vibrational energy across looser sutures. Furthermore, bleached skeletons of fed urchins broke at lower apically applied forces than bleached skeletons of unfed urchins, indicating that the sutures of fed urchins had been held together relatively loosely by sutural ligaments. Thus, the apparently rigid dome-like skeleton of urchins sometimes transforms into a flexible, jointed membrane as sutures loosen and become flexible during growth.",0.008010269,0.01363579,0.031360745,0.007786399,0.94726914,0.016899237,0.024859611,0.037887897,0.014523937,0.0548491,0.008984461,0.006276861,0.016482422,0.012218661,0.2708741,0.00904931,0.016987411,0.013818544,0.014471472,0.00548966,0.031502012,0.009013526,0.008077121,0.026380295,0.16439235,0.015839674,0.6622677,0.018364772,0.027816871,"['diatoms', 'marine diatom']","[0.041095890410958, 0.013698630136986]","[1.0, 0.33333333333333304]"

However, there are very significant gaps in our understanding of how diatoms take up and assimilate inorganic C. Diatom plastids originate from secondary endosymbiosis with a red alga and their Form ID Rubisco (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase) from horizontal gene transfer, which means that embryophyte paradigms can only give general guidance as to their C acquisition mechanisms. Although diatom Rubiscos have relatively high CO2 affinity and CO2/O2 selectivity, the low diffusion coefficient for CO2 in water has the potential to restrict the rate of photosynthesis. Diatoms growing in their natural aquatic habitats operate inorganic C concentrating mechanisms (CCMs), which provide a steady-state CO2 concentration around Rubisco higher than that in the medium. How these CCMs work is still a matter of debate. However, it is known that both CO2 and HCO3− are taken up, and an obvious but as yet unproven possibility is that active transport of these species across the plasmalemma and/or the four-membrane plastid envelope is the basis of the CCM. In one marine diatom there is evidence of C4-like biochemistry which could act as, or be part of, a CCM. Alternative mechanisms which have not been eliminated include the production of CO2 from HCO3− at low pH maintained by a H+ pump, in a compartment close to that containing Rubisco.",0.013463094,0.006390073,0.008008648,0.010987814,0.011163147,0.004686516,0.003506885,0.28013146,0.009626271,0.012289807,0.017694578,0.036218766,0.029489962,0.007233815,0.004627528,0.004842089,0.004367507,0.006492513,0.057197124,0.003117302,0.006519349,0.004824552,0.01805277,0.00796646,0.004574038,0.003995321,0.003549931,0.006000503,0.007488221,[],[],[]

In order to map genomic contacts, Lieberman-Aiden et al. (p. 289, see the cover) developed a technique to allow the detection of all interactions between genomic loci in the eukaryotic nucleus followed by deep sequencing. This technology was used to map the organization of the human genome and to examine the spatial proximity of chromosomal loci at one megabase resolution. The map suggests that the genome is partitioned into two spatial compartments that are related to local chromatin state and whose remodeling correlates with changes in the chromatin state. Chromosomes are organized in a fractal knot-free conformation that is densely packed while easily folded and unfolded. We describe Hi-C, a method that probes the three-dimensional architecture of whole genomes by coupling proximity-based ligation with massively parallel sequencing. We constructed spatial proximity maps of the human genome with Hi-C at a resolution of 1 megabase. These maps confirm the presence of chromosome territories and the spatial proximity of small, gene-rich chromosomes. We identified an additional level of genome organization that is characterized by the spatial segregation of open and closed chromatin to form two genome-wide compartments. At the megabase scale, the chromatin conformation is consistent with a fractal globule, a knot-free, polymer conformation that enables maximally dense packing while preserving the ability to easily fold and unfold any genomic locus. The fractal globule is distinct from the more commonly used globular equilibrium model.

Metal-based nanoparticles have been linked to both environmental and animal toxicity in a variety of studies. Perhaps the greatest concern involves the large amounts of TiO2 nanoparticles that are used in commercial sunscreens. As an alternative to using these potentially hazardous metal-based nanoparticles, we have isolated organic nanoparticles from English ivy (Hedera helix). In this study, ivy nanoparticles were evaluated for their potential use in sunscreens based on four criteria: 1) ability to absorb and scatter ultraviolet light, 2) toxicity to mammalian cells, 3) biodegradability, and 4) potential for diffusion through skin.ResultsPurified ivy nanoparticles were first tested for their UV protective effects using a standard spectrophotometric assay. Next the cell toxicity of the ivy nanoparticles was compared to TiO2 nanoparticles using HeLa cells. The biodegradability of these nanoparticles was also determined through several digestion techniques. Finally, a mathematical model was developed to determine the potential for ivy nanoparticles to penetrate through human skin. The results indicated that the ivy nanoparticles were more efficient in blocking UV light, less toxic to mammalian cells, easily biodegradable, and had a limited potential to penetrate through human skin. When compared to TiO2 nanoparticles, the ivy nanoparticles showed decreased cell toxicity, and were easily degradable, indicating that they provided a safer alternative to these nanoparticles.ConclusionsWith the data collected from this study, we have demonstrated the great potential of ivy nanoparticles as a sunscreen protective agent, and their increased safety over commonly used metal oxide nanoparticles.",0.003415531,0.024471575,0.00251583,0.012105676,0.004988022,0.003551594,0.006537533,0.004290128,0.002773328,0.00386766,0.05288564,0.003390048,0.013901392,0.008169776,0.004386697,0.018714182,0.002310679,0.010214004,0.004240097,0.003267139,0.00863937,0.004135914,0.07618453,0.003098896,0.006294127,0.023936043,0.004537867,0.017773788,0.003884979,"['macrotermes michaelseni', 'macrotermes', 'odontotermes obesus', 'odontotermes']","[0.0, 0.015873015873015, 0.0, 0.015873015873015]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]"

Recent experimental evidence in the mounds of a single species, the south Asian termite Odontotermes obesus, suggests that the daily oscillations of radiant heating associated with diurnal insolation patterns drive convective flow within them. How general this mechanism is remains unknown. To probe this, we consider the mounds of the African termite Macrotermes michaelseni, which thrives in a very different environment. By directly measuring air velocities and temperatures within the mound, we see that the overall mechanisms and patterns involved are similar to that in the south Asian species. However, there are also some notable differences between the physiology of these mounds associated with the temporal variations in radiant heating patterns and CO2 dynamics. Because of the difference between direct radiant heating driven by the position of the sun in African conditions, and the more shaded south Asian environments, we see changes in the convective flows in the two types of mounds. Furthermore, we also see that the south Asian mounds show a significant overturning of stratified gases, once a day, while the African mounds have a relatively uniform concentration of CO2.

Ants, cockroaches, and collembola recognize their dead using unsaturated fatty acids (e.g., oleic or linoleic acid) as “necromone” cues. Ants, bees, and termites remove dead from their nests (necrophoric behavior) whereas semi-social species seal off corpses or simply avoid their dead or injured (necrophobic behavior). Alarm and avoidance responses to exudates from injured conspecifics are widespread. This involves diverse pheromones, complex chemistry and learning. We hypothesized that necromones are a phylogenetically ancient class of related signals and predicted that terrestrial Isopoda (that strongly aggregate and lack known dispersants) would avoid body fluids and corpses using fatty acid “necromones.” Isopods were repelled by crushed conspecifics (blood), intact corpses, and alcohol extracts of bodies. As predicted, the repellent fraction contained oleic and linoleic acids and authentic standards repelled several isopod species. We further predicted a priori that social caterpillars (lacking known dispersants) would be repelled by their own body fluids and unsaturated fatty acids. Both tent caterpillars and fall webworms avoided branches treated with conspecific body fluid. Oleic and linoleic acids were also strongly avoided by both species.

However, existing reserves and national parks are unlikely to incorporate the long-term and large-scale dynamics of ecosystems. Hence, conservation strategies have to actively incorporate the large areas of land that are managed for human use. For ecosystems to reorganize after large-scale natural and human-induced disturbances, spatial resilience in the form of ecological memory is a prerequisite. The ecological memory is composed of the species, interactions and structures that make ecosystem reorganization possible, and its components may be found within disturbed patches as well in the surrounding land-scape.

That birds should adjust wing sweep to suit glide speed has been predicted qualitatively by analytical glide models, which extrapolated the wing’s performance envelope from aerodynamic theory. Here we describe the aerodynamic and structural performance of actual swift wings, as measured in a wind tunnel, and on this basis build a semi-empirical glide model. By measuring inside and outside swifts’ behavioural envelope, we show that choosing the most suitable sweep can halve sink speed or triple turning rate. Extended wings are superior for slow glides and turns; swept wings are superior for fast glides and turns. This superiority is due to better aerodynamic performance—with the exception of fast turns. Swept wings are less effective at generating lift while turning at high speeds, but can bear the extreme loads. Finally, our glide model predicts that cost-effective gliding occurs at speeds of 8–10 m s-1, whereas agility-related figures of merit peak at 15–25 m s-1. In fact, swifts spend the night (‘roost’) in flight at 8–10 m s-1 (ref. 11), thus our model can explain this choice for a resting behaviour. Morphing not only adjusts birds’ wing performance to the task at hand, but could also control the flight of future aircraft.",0.010378774,0.012019077,0.017411238,0.007639433,0.031994242,0.030294219,0.025004597,0.006369846,0.018399645,0.005938682,0.005727756,0.007857053,0.014193327,0.015068304,0.007707783,0.006212463,0.8623596,0.010804608,0.012555493,0.02298463,0.030488076,0.015866872,0.037178863,0.009513203,0.009678436,0.012092545,0.006981228,0.007009143,0.017701775,"['bee', 'bees', 'honeybee']","[0.121621621621621, 0.108108108108108, 0.006756756756756001]","[1.0, 0.8888888888888881, 0.055555555555555004]"

We investigated brood nest thermoregulation at the level of individual worker behaviour and the transfer of heat from workers to the brood. Worker bees contribute to the regulation of brood nest temperature by producing heat while sitting motionless on the caps of brood cells. We report here an additional, newly observed heating strategy where heating bees enter empty cells between sealed brood cells and remain there motionless for periods of up to 45 min. Individually marked worker bees on the surface of sealed brood cells maintained thorax temperatures (Tth) between 32.2±1.0°C and 38.1±2.5°C (mean ± s.d.; N=20 bees) with alternating warming and cooling periods. Most of the observed bees made one or several long-duration visits (>2 min) to empty cells within the sealed brood area. Tth at the time bees entered a cell [Tth(entry)] was 34.1–42.5°C (N=40). In 83% of these cell visits, Tth(entry) was higher (up to 5.9°C; mean 2.5±1.5°C; N=33) than the mean Tth of the same bee. High values of Tth(entry) resulted from preceding heating activity on the comb surface and from warm-ups just prior to cell visits during which Tth increased by up to +9.6°C. Bees inside empty cells had mean Tth values of 32.7±0.1°C (resting bees) to 40.6±0.7°C (heat-producing bees) during long-duration cell visits without performing any visible work. Heating behaviour inside cells resembles heating behaviour on the brood cap surface in that the bees appear to be inactive, but repeated warmings and coolings occur and Tth does not fall below the optimum brood temperature. Bees staying still inside empty cells for several minutes have previously been considered to be `resting bees'. We find, however, that the heating bees can be distinguished from the resting bees not only by their higher body temperatures but also by the continuous, rapid respiratory movements of their abdomens. By contrast, abdominal pumping movements in resting bees are discontinuous and interrupted by long pauses. Heat transfer to the brood from individual bees on the comb surface and from bees inside empty cells was simulated under controlled conditions. Heating on the comb surface causes a strong superficial warming of the brood cap by up to 3°C within 30 min. Heat transfer is 1.9–2.6 times more efficient when the thorax is in touch with the brood cap than when it is not. Heating inside empty cells raises the brood temperature of adjacent cells by up to 2.5°C within 30 min. Heat flow through the comb was detectable up to three brood cells away from the heated thorax.",0.008292151,0.012518591,0.007191622,0.005071157,0.008388184,0.010127466,0.00815188,0.005335168,0.008158189,0.006452873,0.010626195,0.005510345,0.007309875,0.00528571,0.003310523,0.012393919,0.006034003,0.007722151,0.005848965,0.007436562,0.008653875,0.007195491,0.93270874,0.003520846,0.008191706,0.007802994,0.006159204,0.009345029,0.010053142,"['bats', 'mammals']","[0.035087719298245, 0.017543859649122]","[1.0, 0.5]"

The bat wing contains five digits, and its specialized membrane is covered with stiff, microscopically small, domed hairs. We provide here unique empirical evidence that the tactile receptors associated with these hairs are involved in sensorimotor flight control by providing aerodynamic feedback. We found that neurons in bat primary somatosensory cortex respond with directional sensitivity to stimulation of the wing hairs with low-speed airflow. Wing hairs mostly preferred reversed airflow, which occurs under flight conditions when the airflow separates and vortices form. This finding suggests that the hairs act as an array of sensors to monitor flight speed and/or airflow conditions that indicate stall.

The function of this glue depends on metals, raising the possibility that metal-catalyzed oxidation plays a role. The extent and time course of protein oxidation was measured by immunoblotting to detect the resulting carbonyl groups. Several proteins, particularly one with a relative molecular mass (Mr) of 165×103, were heavily oxidized. Of the proteins known to distinguish the glue from non-adhesive mucus, only specific size variants were oxidized. The oxidation appears to occur within the first few seconds of secretion. Although carbonyls were detected by 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) in denatured proteins, they were not easily detected in the native state. The presence of reversible cross-links derived from carbonyls was tested for by treatment with sodium borohydride, which would reduce uncross-linked carbonyls to alcohols, but stabilize imine bonds formed by carbonyls and thus lead to less soluble complexes. Consistent with imine bond formation, sodium borohydride led to a 20–35% decrease in the amount of soluble protein with a Mr of 40–165 (×103) without changing the carbonyl content per protein. In contrast, the nucleophile hydroxylamine, which would competitively disrupt imine bonds, increased protein solubility in the glue. Finally, the primary amine groups on a protein with a Mr of 15×103 were not accessible to acid anhydrides. The results suggest that cross-links between aldehydes and primary amines contribute to the cohesive strength of the glue.",0.013814197,0.005353811,0.00984174,0.013132428,0.009467621,0.013822274,0.004567061,0.007823561,0.009812727,0.9229626,0.006472244,0.009900335,0.006744402,0.014153231,0.020270495,0.007017897,0.006346552,0.010290578,0.010616734,0.012745081,0.004469311,0.01069044,0.008511343,0.013459985,0.010151261,0.011781029,0.007019389,0.017689135,0.018059893,"['alligator', 'american alligator', 'alligators']","[0.058823529411764004, 0.0, 0.058823529411764004]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0]"

Most of them pass their vegetative phase in winter. Leaves and in some cases axes, display a circinate, helical, tortuose, or serpentine shape and/or their margins are undulate or crispate, or (and) are provided with a ciliate or fimbriate pilosity of uncommon appearance. These morphomes, rare elsewhere among monocotyledons, promote an increased deposit of dew and fog by enlargement of surfaces and edges, keeping at the same time the overall size of the leaves restricted. They improve the water budget of these plants in three ways: (1) remnant water on the aerial parts retards the transpiration stress at day-time; (2) although special organs for direct absorption seem to be absent, field and laboratory tests show, that considerable uptake of water occurs but in quantities not exceeding that capacity found in many non-desert plants; (3) the water harvest of the leaves dripping to the soil and reaching the root zone, where it is stored in tubers, bulbs, corms and rhizomes, appears to be the main contribution. Experiments using artificial, directional fog and metal models imitating the natural profiles demonstrate that a surplus of water in efficiency rates of 0.1–66% is collected by the various surface types compared to a standard model with a non-sculptured (plain) frontal surface of the same size. The higher rates are sufficient to moisten the underlying soil down to the rhizosphere. The circumference of roots and storage organs probably does not exceed the area shadowed by the foliage.

Geometric morphometrics are used to quantify shell shape, and performance is estimated for two shell functions: shell strength and hydrodynamics. Aquatic turtle shells differ in shape from terrestrial turtle shells and are characterized by lower frontal areas and presumably lower drag. Terrestrial turtle shells are stronger than those of aquatic turtles; many-to-one mapping of morphology to function does not entirely mitigate a functional trade-off between mechanical strength and hydrodynamic performance. Furthermore, areas of morphospace characterized by exceptionally poor performance in either of the functions are not occupied by any emydid species. Though aquatic and terrestrial species show no significant differences in the rate of morphological evolution, aquatic species show a higher lineage density, indicative of a greater amount of convergence in their evolutionary history.

We tested this hypothesis by assessing the role of stored water during the dry season in three baobab species in Madagascar. In the dry season, leaves are present only during and after leaf flush. We quantified the relative contributions of stem and soil water during this period through measures of stem water content, sap flow and stomatal conductance. Rates of sap flow at the base of the trunk were near zero, indicating that leaf flushing was almost entirely dependent on stem water. Stem water content declined by up to 12% during this period, yet stomatal conductance and branch sap flow rates remained very low. Stem water reserves were used to support new leaf growth and cuticular transpiration, but not to support stomatal opening before the rainy season.

Broad leaves heat rapidly when ambient air flows drop below c. 0.5 m s(-1). Devices implicated in minimizing heating include: reduction in size, lobing, and adjustments of orientation to improve convective cooling; low near-infrared absorptivity; and thickening for short-term heat storage. Different features become relevant when storm gusts threaten to tear leaves and uproot trees with leaf-level winds of 20 m s(-1) or more.

Zaglossus is listed as endangered by the World Conservation Union and data regarding the natural history of long-beaked echidnas are critical to efforts to protect these animals. However, no detailed studies of the ecology of this genus have been published. From 2000 to 2005, I captured 22 Zaglossus bartoni in the Crater Mountain Wildlife Management Area in Simbu Province, Papua New Guinea.

Eleven of the adults captured were followed via radiotelemetry for 1–12 months. The home ranges for these individuals varied in size from 10 to 168 ha. Home-range size was not correlated with body mass, age, or sex. Long-beaked echidna dens were most commonly located in underground burrows, although individual echidnas favored different types of den sites. Mean burrow length was 2.7 m ± 1.8 SD (n = 5, range: 1.3–4.9 m) and mean den depth was 0.48 m ± 7.8 SD (n = 5, range: 0.42–0.57 m) below the soil surface. Animals were never found foraging in daylight. Although no animals were found with eggs or young in the pouch, 1 individual was lactating when captured in April 2002 and again in April 2005.

Here, we show that hummingbirds achieve these functional traits within the limits imposed by a vertebrate endoskeleton and muscle physiology by accentuating a wing inversion mechanism found in other birds and using long-axis rotational movement of the humerus. In hummingbirds, long-axis rotation of the humerus creates additional wing translational movement, supplementing that produced by the humeral elevation and depression movements of a typical avian flight stroke. This adaptation increases the wing-to-muscle-transmission ratio, and is emblematic of a widespread scaling trend among flying animals whereby wing-to-muscle-transmission ratio varies inversely with mass, allowing animals of vastly different sizes to accommodate aerodynamic, biomechanical and physiological constraints on muscle-powered flapping flight.",0.011871711,0.01292994,0.022200862,0.009577077,0.029267926,0.028751258,0.018645624,0.008532769,0.017616376,0.00895355,0.005188369,0.008834807,0.014750185,0.02163328,0.012183839,0.005760099,0.8786168,0.01540322,0.013619797,0.023084328,0.028674137,0.015367478,0.022859503,0.012836734,0.009961825,0.010214862,0.007209464,0.006447488,0.017624259,['cnidarians'],[0.015151515151515001],[1.0]

It consists of a cylindrical capsule, which releases a long tubule upon triggering. Cnidocysts develop inside a giant post-Golgi vesicle by a sequential accumulation of proteins from the Golgi apparatus. Traditionally three types of cnidocysts are distinguished: nematocysts, spirocysts, and ptychocysts. Here we focus on nematocysts, the prototypic cnidocyst and by far most diverse group of cnidocysts in this phylum. The mature nematocyst capsule comprises a collagenous polymer with remarkable biophysical properties, able to withstand an osmotic pressure of 150 bar. Release of the capsule and discharge is probably initiated by classical exocytosis. High-speed studies revealed the kinetics of discharge to be as short as 700 ns, generating an acceleration of 5,400,000 x g and a pressure of 7.7 GPa at the site of impact of the spines onto the prey. Thus nematocysts comprise a powerful molecular spring mechanism releasing energy stored in the wall polymer in the nanosecond time range. During the last few years, genomic, biochemical and structural studies have helped to unravel the molecular composition of the nematocyst supra-structure.

Local interactions among individuals determine their behaviour and regulate the activity of the colony. Harvester ants are recruited for outside work, using networks of brief antennal contacts, in the nest chamber closest to the nest exit: the entrance chamber. Here, we combine empirical observations, image analysis and computer simulations to investigate the structure and function of the interaction network in the entrance chamber. Ant interactions were distributed heterogeneously in the chamber, with an interaction hot-spot at the entrance leading further into the nest. The distribution of the total interactions per ant followed a right-skewed distribution, indicating the presence of highly connected individuals. Numbers of ant encounters observed positively correlated with the duration of observation. Individuals varied in interaction frequency, even after accounting for the duration of observation.

Insect elytra (a portion of the exoskeleton) have evoked worldwide research attention and are believed to serve as fuselages and wings of natural aircraft. This work focuses on the relationship between structure, mechanical behavior, and failure mechanisms of the elytra. We report a failure-mode-optimization (FMO) mechanism that can explain elytra's mechanical behaviors. We show initial evidence that this mechanism makes bio-structures of low-strength materials strong and ductile that can effectively resist shear forces and crack growth. A bio-inspired design of a joint by using the FMO mechanism has been proved by experiments to have a potential to increase the interface shear strength as high as about 2.5 times. The FMO mechanism, which is based on the new concept of property-structure synergetic coupling proposed in this work, offer some thoughts to deal with the notoriously difficult problem of interface strength and to reduce catastrophic failure events.",0.003990965,0.005458244,0.005777773,0.003048713,0.66915196,0.008088893,0.016111398,0.006030372,0.006087081,0.006509843,0.003999013,0.003060577,0.009429063,0.004848876,0.018127123,0.004463563,0.00899084,0.004386685,0.005367617,0.004102808,0.009984602,0.007524769,0.004189702,0.010211214,0.106595986,0.009062318,0.3566269,0.0064977,0.005102853,[],[],[]

Transport networks optimized for efficiency have been shown to be trees, i.e., loopless. However, dicotyledon leaf venation has a large number of closed loops, which are functional and able to transport fluid in the event of damage to any vein, including the primary veins. Inspired by leaf venation, we study two possible reasons for the existence of a high density of loops in transport networks: resilience to damage and fluctuations in load. In the first case, we seek the optimal transport network in the presence of random damage by averaging over damage to each link. In the second case, we seek the network that optimizes transport when the load is sparsely distributed: at any given time most sinks are closed.

The cold adaptations of populations from northern Indiana (∼41°45′ N) and Alaska were compared and, as expected, the supercooling points (the temperatures at which they froze) of these freeze-avoiding insects were significantly lower in Alaska insects. Both populations produce glycerol, but the concentrations in Alaska larvae were much higher than in Indiana insects (∼2.2 and 0.5 mol l–1, respectively). In addition, both populations produce antifreeze proteins. Interestingly, in the autumn both populations have the same approximate level of hemolymph thermal hysteresis, indicative of antifreeze protein activity, suggesting that they synthesize similar amounts of antifreeze protein. A major difference is that the Alaska larvae undergo extreme dehydration in winter wherein water content decreases from 63–65% body water (1.70–1.85 g H2O g–1 dry mass) in summer to 28–40% body water (0.40–0.68 g H2O g–1 dry mass) in winter. These 2.5–4.6-fold reductions in body water greatly increase the concentrations of antifreeze in the Alaska insects. Glycerol concentrations would increase to 7–10 mol l–1 while thermal hysteresis increased to nearly 13°C (the highest ever measured in any organism) in concentrated hemolymph. By contrast, Indiana larvae do not desiccate in winter. The Alaska population also undergoes a diapause while insects from Indiana do not. The result of these, and likely additional, adaptations is that while the mean winter supercooling points of Indiana larvae were approximately –23°C, those of Alaska larvae were –35 to– 42°C, and at certain times Alaska C. clavipes did not freeze when cooled to –80°C.",0.007171058,0.011986625,0.007864405,0.004350901,0.010364997,0.010646352,0.009043762,0.006133428,0.009083256,0.006958841,0.010116703,0.006047777,0.007050897,0.005202989,0.004059168,0.01565125,0.007072024,0.007321479,0.005708185,0.008128172,0.009448318,0.006262536,0.943293,0.004018054,0.008956165,0.008494845,0.006254893,0.008076391,0.012482585,"['dynastes', 'dynastes hercules']","[0.026315789473684, 0.026315789473684]","[1.0, 1.0]"

In this Opinion article, we argue that wounding due to herbivory and crawling by insect larvae causes rapid GABA accumulation via the disruption of cellular compartmentation and the release of the acidic vacuolar contents to the cytosol. The activity of glutamate decarboxylase, the cytosolic enzyme responsible for GABA synthesis, has an acidic pH optimum. Subsequent GABA ingestion has a plant defense function by directly acting on GABA-regulated invertebrate neuromuscular junctions. Plants with an enhanced GABA-producing capacity reduce herbivory by invertebrate pests.

Behavioral data on nesting Florida Scrub Jays (Aphelocoma c. coerulescens) and American Crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) support the parental nutrition, and not the economic disposal hypothesis.

The history of investigation of the ant-plants is briefly reviewed and the external morphology of the plants described. Within Papua New Guinea ant-plants are abundant in open-canopied environments and less common but more diverse in rain forest. They also occur terrestrially above 2400 m. Initial tuber development was found to be similar that described by Treub (1883). Later cavities are formed by successive, increasingly complex phellogens. In certain Myrmecodia spp. later cavities are differentiated into regions with distinct surface characteristics, shapes and positions. Cavities in Hydnophytum are simpler in shape but sometimes differentiated in other ways. The anatomy of the cavity surfaces, especially the putative absorption sites ('warts') is described. 
 
The ant Iridomyrmex cordatus, which is common in ant-plants in other regions, is found in ant-plants in open habitats in Papua New Guinea, but is replaced by I. cf. scrutator in rain forest and above 2000 m. Two fungi, known also from ant-plants in Java (Miehe, 1911a), occur in the cavities of ant-plants throughout Papua New Guinea. Arthrocladium sp. Papend. grows on cavity surfaces where ant faecal material is present and the other (an unidentified Monilialine fungus) is parasitic on smooth, clean surfaces. The former is most common and the latter almost confined to Myrmecodia spp. occupied by Iridomyrmex cordatus. 
 
Experiments suggested that both Hydnophytum under artificial conditions and Myrmecodia under field conditions grow better in the presence than absence of Iridomyrmex cordatus and that the stimulus might be that of minerals supplied by the ants. Radioisotopes in both organic and inorganic compounds fed to I. cordatus were deposited preferentially by the ants on the warted cavity surfaces where ant faecal material was present, and were absorbed by the plants. In the discussion it is argued that the plant/ant relationship has had a considerable influence on both the ecology and evolution of the plants, but that this varies in different species.",0.017363952,0.003342024,0.018412312,0.002380601,0.007156975,0.001396728,0.011805458,0.005551304,0.008597943,0.004290175,0.003410422,0.003804513,0.004628336,0.002620596,0.009485028,0.022772096,0.00347543,0.006889259,0.007869615,0.006444654,0.007835838,0.005726659,0.007292712,0.03887413,0.002391203,0.005295338,0.001475713,0.013659778,0.00345573,"['macrotermes michaelseni', 'macrotermes']","[0.0, 0.024390243902439]","[0.0, 1.0]"

When time variations or fluctuations are allowed for, a different class of optimal structures is found, which share the hierarchical organization of trees yet contain loops. The transitions between different network topologies as the parameters of the problem vary are examined. These results may have strong implications for the structure and formation of natural networks, as is illustrated by the example of leaf venation networks.",0.8817183,0.021298647,0.87838405,0.022169758,0.029472893,0.021579307,0.015727393,0.01674578,0.027913827,0.023673888,0.020366242,0.016536014,0.024683736,0.024600085,0.016078083,0.014150605,0.02007623,0.013615608,0.029936422,0.022922743,0.016292196,0.019785844,0.025454937,0.03615832,0.022397777,0.010046818,0.009122495,0.020394264,0.029652525,[],[],[]

The phenomenon called ecosystem engineering is considered with a case study of the mound building termite Macrotermes michaelseni. It is argued that this species acts as an ecosystem engineer across a range of spatial scales, from alteration of local infiltration rates to the creation of landscape mosaics, and that its impacts accrue because of the initiation of biophysical processes that often include feedback mech- anisms. These changes to resource flows are likely to persist for long periods and constrain the biological structure of the habitat.

The natural history of these exploiters is well-described, but relatively little effort has yet been devoted to analysing their ecological or evolutionary significance for mutualism. Exploitation is not a unitary phenomenon, but a set of loosely related phenomena: exploiters may follow mixed strategies or pure strategies at either the species or individual level, may or may not be derived from mutualists, and may or may not inflict significant costs on mutualisms. The evolutionary implications of these different forms of exploitation, especially the threats they pose to the stability of mutualism, have as yet been minimally explored. Studies of this issue are usually framed in terms of a “temptation to defect” that generates a destabilizing conflict of interest between partners. I argue that this idea is in fact rather inappropriate for interpreting most observed forms of exploitation in mutualisms.

This poses questions about how they manage their respiration, cut off from a free flow of gases. We measured the gradient in oxygen partial pressure (PO2) away from the snouts of buried echidnas and oxygen consumption (V̇O2) in five individuals under similar conditions, in two substrates with different air-filled porosities (fa). A theoretical diffusion model indicated that diffusion alone was insufficient to account for the flux of oxygen required to meet measured rates of V̇O2. However, it was noticed that echidnas often showed periodic movements of the anterior part of the body, as if such movements were a deliberate effort to flush the tidal air space surrounding their nostrils. These `flushing movements' were subsequently found to temporarily increase the levels of interstitial oxygen in the soil around the head region. Flushing movements were more frequent while V̇O2 was higher during the burrowing process, and also in substrate with lower fa. We conclude that oxygen supply to buried echidnas is maintained by diffusion through the soil augmented by periodic flushing movements, which ventilate the tidal airspace that surrounds the nostrils.",0.011306566,0.001861792,0.005237226,0.001792758,0.003509674,0.002780061,0.002615781,0.007898946,0.015400861,0.003931152,0.009323973,0.005576534,0.006436877,0.001849589,0.008971592,0.023383215,0.001447211,0.005903833,0.024429988,0.003297635,0.009585992,0.001445854,0.02088152,0.005832579,0.002315721,0.00242542,0.00208252,0.013695145,0.004120259,"['beetles', 'gloriosa', 'chrysina', 'scarab beetles']","[0.030303030303030002, 0.10606060606060601, 0.045454545454545005, 0.015151515151515001]","[0.28571428571428503, 1.0, 0.42857142857142805, 0.14285714285714202]"

Spoonbills (Aves: Platalea spp., Ciconiiformes) characteristically feed by wading in shallow water and rhythmically sweeping their submerged and partially opened bills in an arc. This bill sweeping contrasts with the direct grasp, strike or stab employed by related species (storks, Ciconiidae; herons, Ardeidae) for similar prey (crustaceans, fish). A related feature of spoonbills is the shape of the bill: both upper and lower mandibles are dorso-ventrally flattened, the upper mandible being convex in cross section while the lower is tucked in, to result in an almost flat surface. The bill is wide throughout and broadens at the distal end. The hypothesis presented here is that spoonbills use their broad, flattened bills and lateral sweeping to shed a vortex off the tip of the bill that results in hydrodynamic suction on the bottom, which disturbs and moves prey. To achieve this the bill is used as a hydrofoil. The analysis predicts, and experimental results show that (1) in feeding, the tip of the bill is kept close to the bottom, (2) there is an inverse relationship between bill immersion depth and sweeping speed, and (3) bill sweeping over submerged prey results in the prey being lifted into the water column. This is the first reported case of an avian bill being used as a hydrofoil.",0.5823705,0.024303818,0.10350703,0.013578841,0.03387435,0.85716295,0.013174008,0.009237079,0.089677416,0.021656292,0.019307649,0.013924478,0.018209191,0.013555676,0.007584384,0.008477588,0.030633528,0.019878348,0.023789383,0.18262638,0.018541826,0.013064112,0.028464112,0.030004036,0.013852505,0.01401997,0.010093145,0.010880552,0.014672938,['gymnarchus niloticus'],[0.0],[0]

Chrysina gloriosa LeConte 1854, a scarab beetle found in montane juniper forests of the extreme southwestern United States and northern Mexico, are camouflaged in juniper foliage; however, when viewed with right circularly polarizing filters, the beetles exhibit a stark black contrast. Given the polarization‐specific changes in the appearance of C. gloriosa, we hypothesized that C. gloriosa can detect circularly polarized light. We tested for phototactic response and differential flight orientation of C. gloriosa toward different light stimuli. Chrysina gloriosa exhibited (a) positive phototaxis, (b) differential flight orientation between linear and circularly polarized light stimuli of equal intensities, and (c) discrimination between circularly polarized and unpolarized lights of different intensities consistent with a model of circular polarization sensitivity based on a quarter‐wave plate. These results demonstrate that C. gloriosa beetles respond differentially to circularly polarized light. In contrast, Chrysina woodi Horn 1885, a close relative with reduced circularly polarized reflection, exhibited no phototactic discrimination between linear and circularly polarized light.

A high-resolution Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) imaging camera system is used to record kinematics of steady swimming as well as maneuvering in G. niloticus. Based on experimental data, this paper discusses the kinematics (cruising speed, wave speed, cycle frequency, amplitude, lateral displacement) of forward as well as backward swimming and maneuvering.During forward swimming, the propulsive force is generated mainly by undulations of the dorsal fin while the body axis remains straight. The kinematic parameters (wave speed, wavelength, cycle frequency, amplitude) have statistically significant correlations with cruising speed. In addition, the yaw at the head is minimal during steady swimming. From experimental data, the maximal lateral displacement of head is not more than 1% of the body length, while the maximal lateral displacement of the whole body is not more than 5% of the body length. Another important feature is that G. niloticus swims backwards using an undulatory mechanism that resembles the forward undulatory swimming mechanism. In backward swimming, the increase of lateral displacement of the head is comparatively significant; the amplitude profiles of the propulsive wave along the dorsal fin are significantly different from those in forward swimming. When G. niloticus does fast maneuvering, its body is first bent into either a C shape or an S shape, then it is rapidly unwound in a travelling wave fashion. It rarely maneuvers without the help of the tail fin and body bending.",0.026013775,0.008981888,0.010150174,0.005179371,0.007390838,0.05535887,0.007941484,0.007919915,0.018663727,0.016851012,0.012709921,0.010764228,0.013233509,0.004944168,0.008205296,0.019795677,0.013136543,0.016777787,0.008277725,0.87050706,0.009148786,0.01092174,0.021233983,0.018190527,0.010746953,0.014498768,0.008448399,0.030599345,0.018862436,[],[],[]

Additionally, the tape is less sensitive to contamination by dust particles than a commercially available pressure-sensitive adhesive tape. Even if the 'insect tape' is contaminated, it can be washed with a soap solution in water, in order to completely recover its adhesive properties. We have successfully applied the tape to the 120 g wall-climbing robot Mini-Whegs.

We measured discrimination of sound-source separation using a newly developed procedure involving the habituation and recovery of the pupillary dilation response. The smallest discriminable change of source location was found to be about two times finer in azimuth than in elevation. Recordings from neurons in its midbrain space map revealed that their spatial tuning, like the spatial discrimination behavior, was also better in azimuth than in elevation by a factor of about two. Because the PDR behavioral assay is mediated by the same circuitry whether discrimination is assessed in azimuth or in elevation, this difference in vertical and horizontal acuity is likely to reflect a true difference in sensory resolution, without additional confounding effects of differences in motor performance in the two dimensions.

For this purpose, we compared snake-inspired anisotropic microstructured surfaces to other microstructured surfaces with isotropic and anisotropic geometry. To exclude that the friction measurements were influenced by physico-chemical variations, all friction measurements were performed on the same epoxy polymer. For frictional measurements a microtribometer was used. Original data were processed by fast Fourier transformation (FFT) with a zero frequency related to the average friction and other peaks resulting from periodic stick-slip behavior. The data showed that the specific ventral surface ornamentation of snakes does not only reduce the frictional coefficient and generate anisotropic frictional properties, but also reduces stick-slip vibrations during sliding, which might be an adaptation to reduce wear. Based on this extensive comparative study of different microstructured polymer samples, it was experimentally demonstrated that the friction-induced stick-slip behavior does not solely depend on the frictional coefficient of the contact pair.",0.013370708,0.010646195,0.01171542,0.006203532,0.007506836,0.013157807,0.009091286,0.007701417,0.009778579,0.019733656,0.003884038,0.008169529,0.008443838,0.008511496,0.005707182,0.010853157,0.013471551,0.005027166,0.004393784,0.012181458,0.016894769,0.007067301,0.015191938,0.008095775,0.008314705,0.008162488,0.011592816,0.010001944,0.8960344,"['camponotus', 'camponotus cruentatus']","[0.018181818181818, 0.018181818181818]","[1.0, 1.0]"

These structures are often supplemented with microtrichia fields of the inner surface of the elytra and adjacent parts of the pterothorax. The present study provides information about the ultrastructure of microtrichia of the dorso‐medial fields of the thorax (TDM) in tenebrionid beetles (Tribolium castaneum, Zophobas rugipes). Epidermal cells located under the TDM field contain large electron‐lucent vesicles connected to rough endoplasmic reticulum. Microtrichia and underlying cuticle of the TDM have a high density of pore channels, which are responsible for transport of an epidermal secretion onto the TDM surface. In order to show the presence of the secretion on the cuticle surface, TDM fields of air‐dried specimens were compared with those in specimens after two treatments, such as (1) dehydration in ethanol and acetone, and (2) dental‐wax‐cast technique applied to living beetles. This revealed the presence of the nonvolatile film on the intact microtrichial surface. Possible functions of this film are suggested to be (1) the increase of adhesive forces in the contact area and (2) providing soft coupling and release of two corresponding parts of the elytra‐locking device.

Unlike the dispersal mechanisms of many desert plants, the whole dead skeleton of Anastatica hierochuntica is involved in seed dispersal and preservation. This process depends on the hygrochastic nature of the lignified conducting tissue that bends when dry and straightens under wet conditions. An anatomical interpretation of this mechanical movement was investigated.


METHODS
An anatomical study of the stem was conducted on the juvenile plants raised under different water treatments and on the branch-orders of adult A. hierochuntica size-classes.


KEY RESULTS
In the juvenile stem of A. hierochuntica, the area of cortex, conducting tissue and pith increased with water availability. However, the hydraulic conductance decreased, resulting in a better withdrawal of water in water-stressed plants. The anatomical investigation of the hygrochastic mechanism revealed an asymmetric distribution of the cortical tissues, with the conducting tissues of the stem of juvenile and adult plants being larger in the lower side. The hydraulic conductance was better in the basal and middle branch-orders than the terminal ones, permitting better conductance of water to the subsequent branch-orders.


CONCLUSIONS
The lignified conducting tissue of the whole stem, having a hygrochastic nature, controls the movement of the branches. The greater amount of conducting tissue associated with a higher density of wide xylem vessels was observed in the lower side of the stem as compared with the upper side. Consequently, the conducting tissue in the lower side of the stem was suggested to be more effective in the opening process of the curled dry branches through better and more rapid conductance of water. Alternatively, due to the few narrow xylem vessels in the upper side of the stem, it was likely that the conducting tissue in the upper side is more effective in the closing process by providing more rapid drying. The mechanical rise of water and the related hygrochastic efficiency were maximized in the basal and middle branch-orders that are mostly involved in the mechanical movement.",0.052667562,0.00971508,0.020704748,0.009717503,0.018152528,0.007863556,0.006968618,0.03259738,0.01713168,0.026301421,0.021306098,0.040808875,0.019371055,0.037488483,0.012006643,0.015255597,0.012479264,0.021573922,0.90912825,0.010005051,0.026885387,0.017665602,0.02456963,0.008739822,0.012860527,0.015553742,0.009733466,0.01993236,0.011209915,[],[],[]

For example, ants are able to focus their foraging effort on the most rewarding food source. While this phenomenon is well known, the link between the food source quality and the intranidal food dissemination networks and its dynamics has been neglected. Here, we analysed the global dynamics of food dissemination in Camponotus cruentatus workers, after feeding on a low (0.1 mol l−1) or on a high (1 mol l−1) sucrose concentration food source. We also analysed the trophallaxis activity at the individual level and built the complete network of trophallaxis. The results reveal that the dynamics of food dissemination and the structure of the trophallaxis network are robust and independent of the food concentration. We discuss these results in the light of recent advances in the study of efficiency in food management in ants. Summary: Ants show a robust network of food dissemination that is not dependent on the quality of the food.",0.079706796,0.006193562,0.015456028,0.047799118,0.005175997,0.003568776,0.003541886,0.012367629,0.005483122,0.03217073,0.009083518,0.018240815,0.009991935,0.13880631,0.007317855,0.005927399,0.009081599,0.03819768,0.39353573,0.007163379,0.011846866,0.069545016,0.015233563,0.009025102,0.007378157,0.009003382,0.004753734,0.00983637,0.011872942,"['bird', 'birds']","[0.074074074074074, 0.074074074074074]","[1.0, 1.0]"

The tongue skeleton is projected from the body via an elastic-recoil mechanism that decouples muscle contraction from tongue projection, amplifying muscle power tenfold. We tested the hypothesis that the elastic-recoil mechanism also endows tongue projection with low thermal dependence by examining the kinematics and dynamics of tongue projection in Hydromantes platycephalus over a range of body temperatures (2-24°C). We found that H. platycephalus maintained tongue-projection performance over the tested temperature range and that tongue projection showed thermal independence (Q(10) values of 0.94-1.04) of all performance parameters including projection distance, average velocity, and peak instantaneous values of velocity, acceleration, and power. Nonelastic, muscle-powered tongue retraction, in contrast, responded to temperature changes significantly differently than elastic tongue projection; performance parameters of retraction displayed thermal dependence typical of muscle-powered movement (Q(10) values of 1.63-4.97). These results reveal that the elastic-recoil mechanism liberates tongue projection from the effects of temperature on muscle contractile rates. We suggest that relative thermal independence is a general characteristic of elastic-recoil mechanisms and may promote the evolution of these mechanisms in ectothermic animals.",0.028790398,0.015154416,0.037826415,0.02167474,0.044364095,0.03564418,0.044113953,0.011899263,0.021739231,0.01295189,0.016300682,0.014840541,0.038439587,0.031333577,0.030314166,0.008333587,0.80265826,0.026508586,0.0333525,0.023800926,0.77345496,0.030230995,0.037197456,0.017089553,0.02248679,0.017849114,0.01391949,0.013659771,0.040278964,[],[],[]

It was postulated that mechanical power amplification must be involved. Dynamic analysis of the vertical jumps performed by two bushbabies confirms the need for a power amplifier. Inverse dynamics coupled to a geometric musculo–skeletal model were used to elucidate the precise nature of the mechanism powering maximal vertical jumps. Most of the power required for jumping is delivered by the vastus muscle–tendon systems (knee extensor). Comparison with the external joint–powers revealed, however, an important power transport from this extensor (about 65%) to the ankle and the midfoot via the bi–articular calf muscles. Peak power output likely implies elastic recoil of the complex aponeurotic system of the vastus muscle. Patterns of changes in length and tension of the muscle–tendon complex during different phases of the jump were found which provide strong evidence for substantial power amplification (times 15). It is argued here that the multiple internal connective tissue sheets and attachment structures of the well–developed bundles of the vastus muscle become increasingly stretched during preparatory crouching and throughout the extension phase, except for the last 13 ms of the push–off (i.e. when power requirements peak). Then, tension in the knee extensors abruptly falls from its maximum, allowing the necessary fast recoil of the tensed tendon structures to occur.",0.05740284,0.02280999,0.85524195,0.026348917,0.04501496,0.06328383,0.06593601,0.07539311,0.073300034,0.0522238,0.019466234,0.034914803,0.033363733,0.0638655,0.06663541,0.027929379,0.62715554,0.017352378,0.024572037,0.047277607,0.05330189,0.05084589,0.0296524,0.8409301,0.04142685,0.023115698,0.014623274,0.018262919,0.69943976,['plants'],[0.014925373134328],[1.0]

This common view was recently questioned because the horizontal movements of the ocean sunfish tracked by acoustic telemetry were independent of ocean currents. However, direct information regarding their locomotor performance under natural conditions is still lacking. By using multi-sensor tags, we show that sunfish indeed swam continuously with frequent vertical movements at speeds of 0.4–0.7 m s–1, which is similar to the records of other large fishes such as salmons, marlins, and pelagic sharks. The acceleration data revealed that they stroked their dorsal and anal fins synchronously (dominant frequency, 0.3–0.6 Hz) to generate a lift-based thrust, as penguins do using two symmetrical flippers. Morphological studies of sunfish (mass, 2–959 kg) showed that the dorsal and anal fins had similar external (symmetrical shape and identical area) and internal (identical locomotory muscle mass) features; however, the muscle shape differed markedly. We conclude that ocean sunfish have functional dorsoventral symmetry with regards to the non-homologous dorsal and anal fins that act as a pair of vertical hydrofoils. Although sunfish lack a swimbladder, we found that they are neutrally buoyant independent of depth because of their subcutaneous gelatinous tissue that has low density and is incompressible. Efficient lift-based swimming in conjunction with neutral buoyancy enables sunfish to travel long distances both horizontally and vertically.",0.03379871,0.015246552,0.015953423,0.007778946,0.018169016,0.8885005,0.006169299,0.009031484,0.032051306,0.01829024,0.01464697,0.007273078,0.012268599,0.007805796,0.007109194,0.005232328,0.017568478,0.008382918,0.006168522,0.3585639,0.008320848,0.007050817,0.023685012,0.019973906,0.011501512,0.011816773,0.01124743,0.007734166,0.01956708,"['rodents', 'kangaroo', 'horse', 'cetacea', 'carnivores', 'marsupials', 'bird', 'lucida', 'vertebrates', 'birds', 'pig', 'squirrels', 'sheep', 'elasmobranchs', 'goat', 'cow', 'crocodilians', 'red kangaroo']","[0.009708737864077001, 0.009708737864077001, 0.009708737864077001, 0.009708737864077001, 0.009708737864077001, 0.009708737864077001, 0.009708737864077001, 0.009708737864077001, 0.029126213592233004, 0.009708737864077001, 0.009708737864077001, 0.009708737864077001, 0.009708737864077001, 0.009708737864077001, 0.009708737864077001, 0.009708737864077001, 0.009708737864077001, 0.0]","[0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304, 1.0, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304, 0.0]"

Here, we link physiological, ecological, and phylogenetic approaches to study the evolution and coexistence of strategies in the Acacia–Pseudomyrmex system. Host plant species represented 2 different strategies. High-reward hosts produced significantly more extrafloral nectar (EFN), food bodies, and nesting space than low-reward hosts, even when being inhabited by the same species of ant mutualist. High-reward hosts were more effectively defended against herbivores and exploited to a lower extent by nondefending ants than low-reward hosts. At the phenotypic level, secretion of EFN and ant activity were positively correlated and a mutualistic ant species induced nectar secretion, whereas a nondefending exploiter did not. All of these mechanisms contribute to the stable association of high-reward hosts with defending ant species. However, exploiter ants are less dependent on the host-derived rewards and can colonize considerable proportions of the low-reward hosts. Mapping these strategies onto phylogenetic trees demonstrated that the low-reward hosts represent the derived clade within a monophyletic group of obligate ant plants and that the observed exploiter ant species evolved their strategy without having a mutualistic ancestor. We conclude that both types of host strategies coexist because of variable net outcomes of different investment–payoff regimes and that the effects of exploiters on the outcome of mutualisms can, thus, increase the diversity within the taxa involved.",0.016682763,0.005264994,0.00944181,0.23385137,0.009269061,0.003262081,0.003636837,0.011195358,0.004059983,0.035919487,0.005686878,0.00924654,0.006954842,0.23338239,0.012944255,0.004497985,0.007072238,0.013793366,0.014257802,0.004956859,0.003884407,0.04148362,0.00503384,0.012933116,0.009323427,0.004918136,0.004527377,0.00866719,0.007394757,"['amphibians', 'ambystoma laterale', 'plethodon cinereus', 'frogs', 'pseudacris triseriata', 'hyla', 'plethodon']","[0.016666666666666, 0.0, 0.016666666666666, 0.016666666666666, 0.016666666666666, 0.033333333333333, 0.016666666666666]","[0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5]"

The phenomenon of 'eye-shine' is seen in a variety of animal species, and is generally thought to be related to the presence of an intraocular reflecting structure, the tapetum lucidum. The tapetum lucidum is a biologic reflector system that is a common feature in the eyes of vertebrates. It normally functions to provide the light-sensitive retinal cells with a second opportunity for photon-photoreceptor stimulation, thereby enhancing visual sensitivity at low light levels. The tapetum lucidum is presented here according to a classification based on the location, as well as the composition, of this reflective layer. Finally, the physical and chemical properties, as well as the origins of the different tapeta lucida, are discussed and compared.


METHODS
The anatomic and biochemical aspects of the tapetum lucidum in various vertebrates are examined. Morphologic observations were made from paraffin and plastic embedded specimens. Specimens were treated with traditional stains and observed by light and transmission electron microscopy.


RESULTS
Some species (primates, squirrels, birds, red kangaroo and pig) do not have this structure and they usually are diurnal animals. In vertebrates, the tapetum lucidum exhibits diverse structure, organization and composition. Therefore, the retinal tapetum (teleosts, crocodilians, marsupials, fruit bat), the choroidal guanine tapetum (elasmobranchs), the choroidal tapetum cellulosum (carnivores, rodents, cetacea), and the choroidal tapetum fibrosum (cow, sheep, goat, horse) are described.


CONCLUSIONS
The tapetum lucidum represents a remarkable example of neural cell and tissue specialization as an adaptation to a dim light environment and, despite these differences, all tapetal variants act to increase retinal sensitivity by reflecting light back through the photoreceptor layer. These variations regarding both its location and structure, as well as the choice of reflective material, may represent selective visual adaptations associated with their feeding behavior, in response to the use of specific wavelengths and amount of reflectance required.",0.016837768,0.86369336,0.013353652,0.014957774,0.008928288,0.012574821,0.00888511,0.012682856,0.008927688,0.009582687,0.004726821,0.007051635,0.009901583,0.0092215,0.009111532,0.004461955,0.007246338,0.014427898,0.007981343,0.010356465,0.008513798,0.014645911,0.02621922,0.008779947,0.010074724,0.011453605,0.011627606,0.009467519,0.012587569,"['vesicular stomatitis virus', 'rna viruses', 'negative-strand rna viruses']","[0.0, 0.020408163265306003, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0]"

A focus on niche construction and ecosystem engineering, however, could provide new insights and methods for conservation biology. Many organisms modulate the availability of resources to other species by causing state changes in biotic or abiotic materials (ecosystem engineering), in the process frequently changing the selection to which the ecosystem engineers and other organisms are exposed (niche construction).

The structure of a negative-strand RNA virus suggests how bullet-shaped rhabdoviruses assemble. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is a bullet-shaped rhabdovirus and a model system of negative-strand RNA viruses. Through direct visualization by means of cryo–electron microscopy, we show that each virion contains two nested, left-handed helices: an outer helix of matrix protein M and an inner helix of nucleoprotein N and RNA. M has a hub domain with four contact sites that link to neighboring M and N subunits, providing rigidity by clamping adjacent turns of the nucleocapsid. Side-by-side interactions between neighboring N subunits are critical for the nucleocapsid to form a bullet shape, and structure-based mutagenesis results support this description.

Here we use ant/plant symbioses involving three plant clades to investigate the evolution of symbioses. We generated phylogenies for the big-eyed arboreal ants (Pseudomyrmecinae), including 72% of their 286 species, as well as for five of their plant host groups, in each case sampling more than 61% of the species. We show that the ant-housing Vachellia (Mimosoideae) clade and its ants co-diversified for the past 5 Ma, with some species additionally colonized by younger plant-nesting ant species, some parasitic. An apparent co-radiation of ants and Tachigali (Caesalpinioideae) was followed by waves of colonization by the same ant clade, and subsequent occupation by a younger ant group. Wide crown and stem age differences between the ant-housing genus Triplaris (Polygonaceae) and its obligate ant inhabitants, and stochastic trait mapping, indicate that its domatium evolved earlier than the ants now occupying it, suggesting previous symbioses that dissolved. Parasitic ant species evolved from generalists, not from mutualists, and are younger than the mutualistic systems they parasitize.

In fishes, light is emitted by organs containing either photogenic cells (intrinsic photophores), which are under direct nervous control, or symbiotic luminous bacteria (symbiotic photophores), whose light is controlled by secondary means such as mechanical occlusion or physiological suppression. The intrinsic photophores of the lantern shark Etmopterus spinax were recently shown as an exception to this rule since they appear to be under hormonal control. Here, we show that hormones operate what amounts to a unique light switch, by acting on a chromatophore iris, which regulates light emission by pigment translocation. This result strongly suggests that this shark's luminescence control originates from the mechanism for physiological colour change found in shallow water sharks that also involves hormonally controlled chromatophores: the lantern shark would have turned the initial shallow water crypsis mechanism into a midwater luminous camouflage, more efficient in the deep-sea environment.",0.014676351,0.014168157,0.006573102,0.007861722,0.016499111,0.011011104,0.005058767,0.011541117,0.01740937,0.023296913,0.009630386,0.009396797,0.015490764,0.009859162,0.011244291,0.009079441,0.008765816,0.88901645,0.012533649,0.019290483,0.01739995,0.011655482,0.013865617,0.013855026,0.012781701,0.013112167,0.011622664,0.014654329,0.009621345,"['larus glaucescens', 'gulls', 'duck', 'larus', 'ducks']","[0.03125, 0.0625, 0.03125, 0.03125, 0.03125]","[0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]"

While a nudibranch’s mucus has been thought to protect the animal from nematocyst discharge, an inhibition of discharge by nudibranch mucus has never been shown. The current study investigated whether mucus from the aeolid nudibranch Aeolidia papillosa would inhibit nematocyst discharge from four species of sea anemone prey. Sea anemone tentacles were contacted with mucus-coated gelatin probes, and nematocyst discharge was quantified and compared with control probes of gelatin only. Mucus from A. papillosa inhibited the discharge of nematocysts from sea anemone tentacles. This inhibition was specifically limited to the anemone species on which the nudibranch had been feeding. When the prey species was changed, the mucus changed within 2 weeks to inhibit the nematocyst discharge of the new prey species. The nudibranchs apparently produce the inhibitory mucus rather than simply becoming coated in anemone mucus during feeding.

At the highest Ta (45°C), both species relied on evaporative heat loss (EHL) to maintain Tb; both panting and licking were used. The eastern grey kangaroo utilised panting (76% of EHL) as the principal mode of EHL, and while this was so for red kangaroos, cutaneous evaporative heat loss (CEHL) was significant (40% of EHL). CEHL appeared to be mainly licking, as evidenced from surface temperatures. Both species utilised peripheral vascular adjustments to control heat flow, as indicated by changes in dry conductance (Cdry). At lower temperatures, Cdry was minimal, but it increased significantly at Ta just below Tb (33°C); in these conditions, the Cdry of red kangaroos was significantly higher than that of eastern grey kangaroos, indicating a greater reliance on dry heat loss. Under conditions where heat flows into the body from the environment (Ta 45°C), there was peripheral vasoconstriction to reduce this inflow; Cdry decreased significantly from the values seen at 33°C in both kangaroos. The results indicated that, while both species have excellent thermoregulatory abilities, the desert red kangaroos may cope better with more extreme temperatures, given that they respond to Ta 45°C with lower respiratory evaporation than do the eastern grey kangaroos.",0.008585648,0.010369551,0.007297736,0.004176411,0.007073859,0.006421665,0.007573778,0.005399246,0.007303427,0.005916793,0.009754667,0.006573702,0.005796475,0.005092505,0.0031347,0.015486547,0.005086666,0.00641307,0.00551885,0.007183882,0.008120049,0.006241091,0.91176486,0.003675008,0.007132067,0.007270834,0.005067794,0.009142628,0.013040518,"['melanophila', 'melanophila acuminata']","[0.025641025641025002, 0.025641025641025002]","[1.0, 1.0]"

This damage is resulting from warmer and drier summers associated with climate change. To test whether defoliated IDF can directly transfer resources to ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosae) regenerating nearby, thus aiding in forest recovery, we examined photosynthetic carbon transfer and defense enzyme response. We grew pairs of ectomycorrhizal IDF ‘donor’ and ponderosa pine ‘receiver’ seedlings in pots and isolated transfer pathways by comparing 35 μm, 0.5 μm and no mesh treatments; we then stressed IDF donors either through manual defoliation or infestation by the budworm. We found that manual defoliation of IDF donors led to transfer of photosynthetic carbon to neighboring receivers through mycorrhizal networks, but not through soil or root pathways. Both manual and insect defoliation of donors led to increased activity of peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase and superoxide dismutase in the ponderosa pine receivers, via a mechanism primarily dependent on the mycorrhizal network. These findings indicate that IDF can transfer resources and stress signals to interspecific neighbors, suggesting ectomycorrhizal networks can serve as agents of interspecific communication facilitating recovery and succession of forests after disturbance.",0.80015993,0.03837789,0.04076622,0.08319871,0.037312,0.017233407,0.023378385,0.03786292,0.010729017,0.05464877,0.026929818,0.07288808,0.030857751,0.8508004,0.023349855,0.032626558,0.049200907,0.062201,0.84045744,0.01996616,0.026780061,0.02891678,0.03607281,0.023870029,0.04087667,0.024623966,0.024336156,0.03547101,0.037341148,"['proboscis', 'lepidoptera', 'galea']","[0.10869565217391301, 0.032608695652173, 0.07608695652173901]","[1.0, 0.30000000000000004, 0.7000000000000001]"

Mathematical calculations showed that the physical properties of the sensilla are such that the expected temperature rise is insufficient for transduction of the infrared signal through mechanical means or as a thermal receptor as previously thought; hence the protein plays the pivotal role in perception of single photons and transmission of the signal within the sensilla.",0.012974703,0.17909789,0.006147821,0.021088807,0.004549773,0.017944425,0.006875603,0.004338166,0.005781296,0.007098972,0.007427526,0.003334841,0.007461205,0.007161985,0.00399689,0.003896749,0.007404713,0.037024774,0.006141028,0.008112061,0.008242987,0.025702355,0.47820362,0.002768225,0.006622688,0.006719939,0.006992559,0.006101306,0.005936931,"['amphibians', 'lampreys', 'amniotes', 'bird', 'vertebrates', 'fish', 'euteleostomi', 'birds', 'jawless vertebrates', 'cyclostomata', 'bony vertebrates', 'tetrapoda', 'mammals', 'crocodile bird', 'delta', 'sharks', 'jawed vertebrates']","[0.009433962264150001, 0.009433962264150001, 0.009433962264150001, 0.009433962264150001, 0.028301886792452, 0.018867924528301, 0.009433962264150001, 0.009433962264150001, 0.0, 0.009433962264150001, 0.0, 0.009433962264150001, 0.009433962264150001, 0.0, 0.009433962264150001, 0.009433962264150001, 0.0]","[0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304, 1.0, 0.6666666666666661, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304, 0.0, 0.33333333333333304, 0.0, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304, 0.0, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304, 0.0]"

Both the galeae (which compose the proboscis) and the basal maxillary components (stipites) were studied in the resting position, in motion, and during feeding. In the resting position the proboscis is coiled so tightly that the surfaces of the consecutive coils are in close contact and the outermost coil touches the ventral side of the head. Cuticular processes of the galeal wall interlock between the coils in this position. In the investigated species they occur on the galeal wall and on the ventral side of the head in varying number and distribution. By the extension of the basal galeal joint, the coiled proboscis is released from its resting position and is elevated continuously. It uncoils in 3–5 steps which effect the entire length simultaneously. Each uncoiling step occurs synchronously with a compression of the stipital tubes on either side of the body. These compression movements pump hemolymph into the galeae. In all investigated Lepidoptera the uncoiled proboscis shows a distinct downward bend at a certain point which is also detectable in anaesthetized or freshly killed animals in some species. This feeding position and the movements of the uncoiled proboscis are similar in all species despite the intrinsic galeal muscles being variously arranged in the galeal lumen in different Lepidoptera. When comparing cross-sections through corresponding regions of coiled and uncoiled proboscises, the curvatures of the dorsal galeal walls remain unchanged. Coiling of the proboscis starts at the tip and progresses to the base. After coiling the proboscis tightly beneath the head, the diameter of the spiral widens due to its elastic properties until the proboscis props itself against the ventral side of the head. This elastic effect combined with the interlocking cuticular processes seems to be responsible for the resting position of the proboscis.",0.005704552,0.003478105,0.013497781,0.003546842,0.009195227,0.07000759,0.004231895,0.004086245,0.36863583,0.07257561,0.00381933,0.009546189,0.004775651,0.002793964,0.010902297,0.008278039,0.005220792,0.005134387,0.003367752,0.007347138,0.006804702,0.006156332,0.00836645,0.017579542,0.003576671,0.006090636,0.00682711,0.010420988,0.059919093,[],[],[]

The success of both processes can be tightly linked in organisms lacking a larval dispersive phase. This review focuses on synchronous gamete release (= spawning) in fucoid algae. These brown macroalgae are important components of temperate intertidal ecosystems in many parts of the world, and achieve synchronous gamete release by integrating various environmental signals. Photosynthesis-dependent sensing of boundary-layer inorganic carbon fluxes, as well as blue light and green light signals, possibly perceived via a chloroplast-located photoreceptor(s), are integrated into pathways that restrict gamete release to periods of low water motion. Avoidance of turbulent and/or high flow conditions in the intertidal zone allows high levels of fertilization success in this group. Temporal patterns and synchrony of spawning in natural populations are reviewed. Most species/populations have a more or less semilunar periodicity, although phase differences occur both between and within species at different geographical locations, raising the possibility that tidal and diurnal cues are more important than semilunar cues in entraining the response. The ecological and evolutionary role(s) of synchronous spawning in the intertidal zone are considered, particularly with regard to hybridization/reproductive isolation in species complexes, and reproductive versus recruitment assurance in the intertidal zone, where synchronous spawning during calm periods may be important for recruitment assurance in addition to fertilization success. Ways in which the roles of spawning synchrony could be tested in closely related species with contrasting mating systems (outcrossing versus selfing) are discussed.",0.024256226,0.04316271,0.013218555,0.7654314,0.006263824,0.021100836,0.011066758,0.040950805,0.041953802,0.05758645,0.033239786,0.67667186,0.024139509,0.04933434,0.01741499,0.014418916,0.019154862,0.02472067,0.043365266,0.019306228,0.01673199,0.78738797,0.028732764,0.02572133,0.011506734,0.020701114,0.008894819,0.015861997,0.020885034,[],[],[]

ENaC dependent reabsorption of Na(+) in the kidney tubules regulates extracellular fluid (ECF) volume and blood pressure by modulating osmolarity. In multi-ciliated cells, ENaC is located in cilia and plays an essential role in the regulation of epithelial surface liquid volume necessary for cilial transport of mucus and gametes in the respiratory and reproductive tracts respectively. The subunits that form ENaC (named as alpha, beta, gamma and delta, encoded by genes SCNN1A, SCNN1B, SCNN1G, and SCNN1D) are members of the ENaC/Degenerin superfamily. The earliest appearance of ENaC orthologs is in the genomes of the most ancient vertebrate taxon, Cyclostomata (jawless vertebrates) including lampreys, followed by earliest representatives of Gnathostomata (jawed vertebrates) including cartilaginous sharks. Among Euteleostomi (bony vertebrates), Actinopterygii (ray finned-fishes) branch has lost ENaC genes.

In cells, microtubules play an essential role in architecture and motility. For example, microtubules give shape to cells, serve as intracellular transport tracks, and act as key elements in important cellular structures such as axonemes and mitotic spindles. To accomplish these varied functions, networks of microtubules in cells are very dynamic, continuously remodeling through stochastic length fluctuations at the ends of individual microtubules. The dynamic behavior at the end of an individual microtubule is termed 'dynamic instability'. This behavior manifests itself by periods of persistent microtubule growth interrupted by occasional switching to rapid shrinkage (called microtubule 'catastrophe'), and then by switching back from shrinkage to growth (called microtubule 'rescue').

Photosystem (PS) I is one of two such photosystems in oxygenic photosynthesis. When co-operating with PS II it uses the energy of light to transfer electrons from plastocyanin or soluble cytochrome c6 to ferredoxin and eventually to NADP. In an alternative pathway, the electrons from ferredoxin are transferred back to plastocyanin via the cytochrome b6f complex. This cyclic electron transport, which does not require the input of free energy by PS II, results in a transmembrane electrochemical gradient that can be used to produce ATP. In plants and green algae the PS I complex consists of two separable functional units: the PS I core, and the light harvesting complex (LHC) I peripheral antenna. The PS I complex in cyanobacteria does not possess the peripheral LHCI antenna, but since the PS I core complexes of cyanobacteria bear a large resemblance to the core complex of plants, a direct comparison of the energy transfer and trapping properties of these complexes is justi¢ed [1,2].",0.030764133,0.023430023,0.008038186,0.005438772,0.004153478,0.003548926,0.002265175,0.06042202,0.009992675,0.013584597,0.003732289,0.021409307,0.008124878,0.004092862,0.005881816,0.003950622,0.002181253,0.035415325,0.024606798,0.007131429,0.007409314,0.006921082,0.006939292,0.004854873,0.002583844,0.002239213,0.00317301,0.004635774,0.008571685,"['greta oto', 'greta']","[0.013888888888888002, 0.013888888888888002]","[1.0, 1.0]"

The cremaster is composed of a 3‐D array of hooked setae that engage with silk fibers spun into layers in a pad on the lower leaf surface. Each seta comprises a shaft terminating in a strongly curved hook, tipped with two lateral barbs. These hook into the silk pad, which is densely laid and built‐up in the central portion, flattening out peripherally. Time‐lapse photography showed that silk pad construction by fifth instar larvae is completed in four distinct spinning movements, producing a random fiber arrangement. It is proposed that such a fiber arrangement provides isotropic strength, giving greater flexibility to the attachment. The cremaster is attached to the silk pad by a series of lateral movements of the pupa's posterior abdomen. This movement, together with the shape of the setal hooks, is thought to be integral to the attachment process. Tensile loading tests showed that attachment failure is due to the breakage of the silk pad, which undergoes gradual destruction before releasing the cremaster. The attachment was found to have high tensile strength and fracture toughness, both of which suggest that it has evolved for the dual purpose of preventing the pupa being pulled from the leaf by a predator and preventing the attachment being weakened by wind, which causes the pupa to swing.",0.013211217,0.021335727,0.11008581,0.02020884,0.026735326,0.050588332,0.020472221,0.04834107,0.9139148,0.05968429,0.027650705,0.12159633,0.022385027,0.017799696,0.69476044,0.06539657,0.020167733,0.0259219,0.018115956,0.04050997,0.016796786,0.021174576,0.016601551,0.86554,0.013334398,0.019628758,0.020055171,0.022617277,0.018909512,['black-capped chickadee'],[0.0],[0]

It is generally believed that the acrosome reaction (AR) of spermatozoa, essential for zona penetration and fusion with oocytes, is triggered by sperm contact with the zona pellucida. Therefore, in most previous studies of sperm–oocyte interactions in the mouse, the cumulus has been removed before insemination to facilitate the examination of sperm–zona interactions. We used transgenic mouse spermatozoa, which enabled us to detect the onset of the acrosome reaction using fluorescence microscopy. We found that the spermatozoa that began the acrosome reaction before reaching the zona were able to penetrate the zona and fused with the oocyte's plasma membrane. In fact, most fertilizing spermatozoa underwent the acrosome reaction before reaching the zona pellucida of cumulus-enclosed oocytes, at least under the experimental conditions we used. The incidence of in vitro fertilization of cumulus-free oocytes was increased by coincubating oocytes with cumulus cells, suggesting an important role for cumulus cells and their matrix in natural fertilization.",0.10206729,0.02287855,0.010397838,0.04448885,0.005479368,0.008144862,0.012428759,0.020224944,0.03056655,0.26530877,0.03237518,0.8161817,0.024218097,0.03296331,0.022590091,0.05568807,0.009470998,0.020232286,0.4347082,0.01971728,0.013670974,0.053612188,0.01705147,0.016776616,0.017082188,0.05241082,0.017487817,0.21205072,0.019578796,['bacteria'],[0.057142857142857],[1.0]

The lips of the valve protrude into the ampulla. Thus the valve functions mainly like a check valve that allows the unidirectional flow of fluid towards the ampulla. Each ampulla-tube foot compartment acts as a semi-autonomous hydraulic system. The lumina of the ampulla and the tube foot are lined with myoepithelia except for the interconnecting channels that pierce the ambulacral plate. The contraction of the ampulla results in an increasing hydraulic pressure that protrudes the tube foot, provided that the valve is closed. The retraction of the tube foot results in a backflow of fluid independent of the condition of the valve. The lips of the valve are folds of the hydrocoel epithelium. The pore slit lies in the midline. The perradial faces of the lips are covered with the squamous epithelium of the lateral water vessel. The ampullar faces are specialized parts of the ampulla myoepithelium. Turgescent cells which form incompressible cushions take the place of the support cells. The valve myocytes run parallel to the pore slit and form processes that run along the base of the ampulla and the perradial channel up to the podial retractor muscle. The findings lead to the hypothesis of multiple control of the ampulla-tube foot system: (1) The mutual activity of the ampulla and the tube foot is indirectly controlled by the lateral and podial nerves which release transmitter substances that diffuse through the connective tissue up to the muscle layers. (2) A muscle-to-muscle conduction causes the simultaneous contraction of the ampulla or the podial retractor muscles. (3) The valve muscles are directly controlled by the processes of the valve myocytes which make contact with the podial retractor. In extreme conditions a backflow of hydrocoel fluid towards the radial water vessel occurs.",0.022922616,0.021781344,0.017899146,0.013963581,0.017898928,0.8342347,0.014106311,0.0166799,0.038316984,0.05628179,0.015823493,0.01899846,0.021697802,0.015164745,0.01231964,0.013005688,0.0323712,0.00915744,0.007487232,0.07302551,0.023358895,0.015176821,0.04501756,0.030867642,0.018765224,0.021202957,0.020438066,0.014147585,0.878839,"['lungfishes', 'sirens', 'siren intermedia', 'african lungfishes']","[0.038461538461538006, 0.038461538461538006, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

Pelvic limbs of six juvenile ostriches were used for this study. The tendon travel technique was used to measure moment arms of 21 muscles at the hip, knee, ankle and metatarsophalangeal joints throughout the ranges of motion observed during level running. Six of the 21 muscles measured were found to have moment arms that did not change with joint angle, whilst the remainder all demonstrated angle‐dependent changes for at least one of the joints crossed. Moment arm lengths tended to be longest for the large proximal muscles, whilst the largest relative changes were found for the moment arms of the distal muscles. For muscles where moment arm varied with joint angle: all hip muscles were found to have increasing moment arms with extension of the joint, knee flexors were found to have moment arms that increased with extension, knee extensor moment arms were found to increase with flexion and ankle extensor moment arms increased with extension. The greatest relative changes were observed in the flexors of the metatarsophalangeal joint, for which a three‐fold increase in moment arm was observed from flexion to full extension.

In this study, we investigated microbial fouling on 2 molluscan egg capsules using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), two-photon laser scanning microscopy (TPLSM) with bacterial viability staining and bacterial attachment experiments with the biofilm-forming Pseudoalteromonas sp. S91 in flow chambers. Results indicated that early stage egg capsules of Dicathais orbita (Neogastropoda) are relatively free of surface microorganisms. Egg capsules during the trocophore stage had a regularly ridged microtexture, but as capsules matured, shedding of the outer wall was observed, followed by the extrusion of unidentified droplets, which then accumulated on the capsule surface in association with bacteria. By comparison, the egg capsules of Sepioteuthis australis (Cephalopoda) were found to have an irregular surface with many hills and valleys that accommodate colonization by a variety of microorganisms. At the later stages of development these squid egg capsules become heavily colonized by algal spores. Cross sections of egg capsules revealed that S. australis capsule walls were about 12 times thicker than D. orbita egg capsules. Staining the egg capsules with BacLight™ also revealed a significantly thicker biofilm, with more live and dead bacteria on S. australis capsules than on those of D. orbita (p < 0.05). Flow chamber exper- iments indicated that the surface of S. australis capsules provided a suitable substrate for colonization by Pseudoalteromonas sp. S91, whereas colonization was significantly less on D. orbita egg capsules after 24 and 72 h (p < 0.01).

We used digital suction cup tags (DTAGs) that concurrently measure pitch, roll, heading, depth and sound (96 kHz sampling rate), to provide the first depiction of the underwater behaviours in which humpback whales engage during bubble-net feeding. Body mechanics and swim paths were analysed using custom visualization software that animates the underwater track of the whale and quantifies tag sensor values. Bubble production was identified aurally and through spectrographic analysis of tag audio records. We identified two classes of behaviour (upward-spiral; 6 animals, 118 events and double-loop; 3 animals, 182 events) that whales used to create bubble nets. Specifically, we show the actual swim path of the whales (e.g., number of revolutions, turning rate, depth interval of spiral), when and where in the process bubbles were expelled and the pattern of bubble expulsion used by the animals. Relative to other baleanopterids, bubble-netting humpbacks demonstrate increased manoeuvrability probably aided by a unique hydrodynamicly enhanced body form. We identified an approximately 20 m depth or depth interval limit to the use of bubble nets and suggest that this limit is due to the physics of bubble dispersal to which humpback whales have behaviourally adapted.

Despite many investigations into the social and ecological conditions under which individuals should form groups, we still know little about the specific behavioural rules that individuals adopt in these contexts, or whether these can be generalized to heterospecifics. Here, we studied collective behaviour in flocks in a community of five species of woodland passerine birds. We adopted an automated data collection protocol, involving visits by RFID-tagged birds to feeding stations equipped with antennae, over two winters, recording 91 576 feeding events by 1904 individuals. We demonstrated highly synchronized feeding behaviour within patches, with birds moving towards areas of the patch with the largest proportion of the flock. Using a model of collective decision making, we then explored the underlying decision rule birds may be using when foraging in mixed-species flocks. The model tested whether birds used a different decision rule for conspecifics and heterospecifics, and whether the rules used by individuals of different species varied. We found that species differed in their response to the distribution of conspecifics and heterospecifics across foraging patches. However, simulating decisions using the different rules, which reproduced our data well, suggested that the outcome of using different decision rules by each species resulted in qualitatively similar overall patterns of movement. It is possible that the decision rules each species uses may be adjusted to variation in mean species abundance in order for individuals to maintain the same overall flock-level response. This is likely to be important for maintaining coordinated behaviour across species, and to result in quick and adaptive flock responses to food resources that are patchily distributed in space and time.",0.009658766,0.013166993,0.02537728,0.1229727,0.004054775,0.011480697,0.004961807,0.006761814,0.006213735,0.012579629,0.006845541,0.007581729,0.010721175,0.022788413,0.005665238,0.005643455,0.012673473,0.00661826,0.005713582,0.008065249,0.003919341,0.48099023,0.013490703,0.01921479,0.006887309,0.007956679,0.003783845,0.004350964,0.010316399,[],[],[]

This article investigates the structural development and morphology of these adhesive pads and aims to understand the underlying structure-function relationship of the attachment process. Based on our results, we discuss possible mechanical consequences of the tendril structure and compare our findings with similar attachment systems in unrelated species in order to identify general strategies of this mode of attachment. Methodology. We investigated the temporal development of the attachment process, including detailed studies of the morphology and anatomy of the adhesive pads, using LM with different staining procedures and SEM. Pivotal results. Young tendrils establish initial contact with a supporting substrate by interlocking with their hook-shaped tips. Touch stimuli induce the tips to develop into adhesive pads by callus-like growth of papillate epidermal cells. Fully grown pads are hemispherical on flat substrates or completely fill out larger cavities of the substrate. By apical cell division, the pad tissue perfectly mimics the microtopography of the substrate and also grows into minute gaps and fissures, establishing firm anchorage by optimal form closure. Additionally, an extracellular substance is visible at the interface between pad and substrate surface, which might act as adhesive. Conclusions. The opportunistic growth and cellular structure make the tendrils and adhesive pads of P. discophora a highly adaptive attachment system. Comparison with other not closely related taxa reveals general principles of this climbing mode, namely, (1) branched tendrils with multiple adhesive pads, (2) papillate cells establishing optimal form closure with the substrate and in some species additionally secreting adhesive substances, (3) free coiling of axes, and (4) persisting anchorage after senescence.",0.014514775,0.005786663,0.009968721,0.012288893,0.010521989,0.009528824,0.00397214,0.008410567,0.008004032,0.9050251,0.005507855,0.009505662,0.006576391,0.013583568,0.026383515,0.006668267,0.005124155,0.0088912,0.009825865,0.010047766,0.003951269,0.008716978,0.006713208,0.010870908,0.00926136,0.009985767,0.006642821,0.01378303,0.015593254,[],[],[]

The term 'subaerial biofilm' (SAB) was coined for microbial communities that develop on solid mineral surfaces exposed to the atmosphere. Subaerial biofilms are ubiquitous, self-sufficient, miniature microbial ecosystems that are found on buildings, bare rocks in deserts, mountains, and at all latitudes where direct contact with the atmosphere and solar radiation occurs. Subaerial biofilms on exposed terrestrial surfaces are characterized by patchy growth that is dominated by associations of fungi, algae, cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria. Inherent subaerial settlers include specialized actinobacteria (e.g. Geodermatophilus), cyanobacteria and microcolonial fungi. Individuals within SAB communities avoid sexual reproduction, but cooperate extensively with one another especially to avoid loss of energy and nutrients. Subaerial biofilm metabolic activity centres on retention of water, protecting the cells from fluctuating environmental conditions and solar radiation as well as prolonging their vegetative life. Atmospheric aerosols, gases and propagatory particles serve as sources of nutrients and inoculum for these open communities. Subaerial biofilms induce chemical and physical changes to rock materials, and they penetrate the mineral substrate contributing to rock and mineral decay, which manifests itself as bio-weathering of rock surfaces. Given their characteristic slow and sensitive growth, SAB may also serve as bioindicators of atmospheric and/or climate change.",0.0175769,0.047960196,0.029095458,0.021883987,0.035962958,0.037994158,0.020831518,0.032025464,0.025129365,0.06683896,0.04062846,0.014334948,0.02764859,0.018387128,0.77665496,0.11174298,0.023825573,0.030838287,0.022089781,0.028715396,0.0377107,0.017615411,0.90373474,0.029495696,0.017747292,0.012999476,0.026461836,0.028368123,0.03709407,"['fish', 'cephalopods', 'abralia veranyi']","[0.011764705882352, 0.011764705882352, 0.011764705882352]","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0]"

Although basic mechanisms of mussel adhesion have been elucidated, little is known about how mussels control the balance between surface adhesion and cohesion, which is critical for successful adhesion without peeling and/or tearing. In this work, we focused on lysine (Lys) molecules which are frequently flanked to Dopa residues in interfacial adhesive proteins, specifically their synergy and anti-synergy on surface adhesion and cohesion. Three model peptides were designed to characterize flanking Lys effects. Through nano-mechanistic analyses, we found that flanking Lys enhanced surface adhesion but disrupted Fe3+-mediated cohesion. Through nuclear magnetic resonance analyses and density functional theory calculations, we corroborated the synergetic effect on surface adhesion and anti-synergetic effect on cohesion. We also confirmed the consistency of flanking Lys effects in the actual protein system. Thus, we, for the first time, discovered that each Dopa molecule in interfacial adhesive proteins is participated in surface adhesion and cohesion differently through controlling the existence of flanking Lys.

The pattern of carbonate dissolution is key to reconstructing changes in deep sea carbonate chemistry and, ultimately, the rate, magnitude, and location of carbon input. Here we show that during the PETM, the deep-sea undersaturation was not homogeneous among the different ocean basins. Application of a sediment model to a suite of data records from different sites and ocean basins shows that a globally uniform decrease in deep-sea carbonate ion concentration ([CO32−]) is inconsistent with the data. Rather, we demonstrate that deep-sea [CO32−] increased from the Atlantic through the Southern Ocean into the Pacific.

This strategy has several potential limitations, two of which are examined here. First, a predator with acute vision may be able to detect the individual photophores on the ventral surface. Second, a predator may be able to detect any mismatch between the spectrum of the bioluminescence and that of the background light. The first limitation was examined by modeling the perceived images of the counterillumination of the squid Abralia veranyi and the myctophid fish Ceratoscopelus maderensis as a function of the distance and visual acuity of the viewer. The second limitation was addressed by measuring downwelling irradiance under moonlight and starlight and then modeling underwater spectra. Four water types were examined: coastal water at a depth of 5 m and oceanic water at 5, 210, and 800 m. The appearance of the counterillumination was more affected by the visual acuity of the viewer than by the clarity of the water, even at relatively large distances. Species with high visual acuity (0.11° resolution) were able to distinguish the individual photophores of some counterilluminating signals at distances of several meters, thus breaking the camouflage. Depth and the presence or absence of moonlight strongly affected the spectrum of the background light, particularly near the surface. The increased variability near the surface was partially offset by the higher contrast attenuation at shallow depths, which reduced the sighting distance of mismatches.

The pad is made of serial parallel pectinated lamellae, which are homologous to the dorsal fin elements of other fishes. Small tooth-like projections of mineralized tissue from the dorsal pad lamella, known as spinules, are thought to increase the remora's resistance to slippage and thereby enhance friction to maintain attachment to a moving host. In this work, the geometry of the spinules and host topology as determined by micro-computed tomography and confocal microscope data, respectively, are combined in a friction model to estimate the spinule contribution to shear resistance. Model results are validated with natural and artificially created spinules and compared with previous remora pull-off experiments. It was found that spinule geometry plays an essential role in friction enhancement, especially at short spatial wavelengths in the host surface, and that spinule tip geometry is not correlated with lamellar position. Furthermore, comparisons with pull-off experiments suggest that spinules are primarily responsible for friction enhancement on rough host topologies such as shark skin. Summary: The geometry of remora fish suction disc spinules increases passive friction on rough host surfaces such as shark skin.",0.014741289,0.005549499,0.008641788,0.011802638,0.009151639,0.012426476,0.003737719,0.007423407,0.008665301,0.9119828,0.00607652,0.009503857,0.00635514,0.011954034,0.025781894,0.006506319,0.004805977,0.009174867,0.010202345,0.01225081,0.004389508,0.00921495,0.007207096,0.01242468,0.009313748,0.010868458,0.006995427,0.015114337,0.015015545,"['perches', 'insects', 'aedes', 'aedes aegypti']","[0.012048192771084001, 0.012048192771084001, 0.012048192771084001, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0]"

These “helpers” assist in all aspects of nesting and their aid significantly increases fledging success. The social unit in these bee-eaters is an extended family clan in which multiple pairs may breed simultaneously (plural breeding). As a result, helpers often have to choose how to allocate their aid among several potential recipients to whom they are unequally related. Using five years of data from a color-marked and genealogically known population of white-fronted bee-eaters in Kenya, we examined the role of kinship in three helping “decisions”: 1) whether or not to become a helper, 2) whom to help, and 3) how much help to provide.1)Kinship between potential donor and recipient was a significant predictor of the likelihood of helping. Fully 44% of the individuals that could have become helpers did not do so. Many of these non-helpers were unrelated mates (“in-laws”) that had paired into their partner's clan and had no genetic link to the available recipients. Others were natal clan members with only distant genealogical ties to the breeders. The conditional probability of helping (see text for definition) decreased significantly with decreasing rh(coefficient of relatedness) between the potential helper and nestling recipients. The presumed cost of helping was a second significant predictor of whether or not a bird became a helper. We considered the expending of effort in providing aid and the delaying of personal reproduction to be costs of helping. Potential helpers that had engaged in high effort activities in the few weeks prior to the helping opportunity showed a decreased likelihood of becoming helpers. Similarly, paired birds (which by virtue of having a mating partner had a greater potential of breeding) were less likely to become helpers than were single individuals.2)Bee-eater helpers preferentially chose to aid their closest genetic relatives. The average relatedness between helpers and the nestlings receiving their aid was 0.33. This degree of kinship was significantly greater than that expected if helpers had selected recipient nests randomly from among those available within their clans. Further evidence of kin discrimination came from analysis of 115 instances in which a helper had two or more nests of differing relatedness simultaneously available as potential recipients. In 108 cases (94%), the helper aided the most closely related one.3)The magnitude of the helping contribution (as measured by provisioning rate) showed no pattern with relatedness between donor and recipient. These data allow testing of various theoretical models for the allocation of aid among kin. Since bee-eaters helped at only one nest at a time, and selected the nest with the most closely related young available, their behavior conforms to an allor-none case of a diminishing returns model and is inconsistent with alternative models based upon the distribution of aid in proportion to relatedness. We conclude that kinship is a major determinant in the decisions both of whether to become a helper, and of whom to help, in white-fronted bee-eaters.",0.005088539,0.002146355,0.025625788,0.012491187,0.004968611,0.004966864,0.003136291,0.007081124,0.007532961,0.010964126,0.004916705,0.019777717,0.006878638,0.009173345,0.003925051,0.005822339,0.00695498,0.004154353,0.008995816,0.00510936,0.002661167,0.106890246,0.014410203,0.030689927,0.005222332,0.005502034,0.001769284,0.002982476,0.004729038,['photuris'],[0.023809523809523003],[1.0]

It is widely assumed that this intimate signaling distance reflects short-range auditory sensitivity of their antennal hearing organs to faint flight tones [7, 8]. To the contrary, we show here that male mosquitoes can hear the female's flight tone at surprisingly long distances-from several meters to up to 10 m-and that unrestrained, resting Ae. aegypti males leap off their perches and take flight when they hear female flight tones. Moreover, auditory sensitivity tests of Ae. aegypti's hearing organ, made from neurophysiological recordings of the auditory nerve in response to pure-tone stimuli played from a loudspeaker, support the behavioral experiments. This demonstration of long-range hearing in mosquitoes overturns the common assumption that the thread-like antennal hearing organs of tiny insects are strictly close-range ears. The effective range of a hearing organ depends ultimately on its sensitivity [9-13]. Here, a mosquito's antennal ear is shown to be sensitive to sound levels down to 31 dB sound pressure level (SPL), translating to air particle velocity at nanometer dimensions. We note that the peak of energy of the first formant of the vowels of the human speech spectrum range from about 200-1,000 Hz and is typically spoken at 45-70 dB SPL; together, they lie in the sweet spot of mosquito hearing.

Extensive beaver meadows form in broad, low-gradient valley segments upstream from glacial terminal moraines. Surveyed sediment volume and total organic carbon content in beaver meadows on the eastern side of Rocky Mountain National Park are extrapolated to create a first-order approximation of landscape-scale carbon storage in these meadows relative to adjacent uplands. Differences in total organic carbon between abandoned and active beaver meadows suggest that valley-bottom carbon storage has declined substantially as beaver have disappeared and meadows have dried. Relict beaver meadows represent ~8% of total carbon storage within the landscape, but the value was closer to 23% when beaver actively maintained wet meadows. These changes reflect the general magnitude of cumulative effects in heterotrophic respiration and organic matter oxidation associated with historical declines in beaver populations across the continent.",0.010538963,0.00284544,0.033753548,0.004042752,0.004841539,0.003739841,0.002967218,0.04180642,0.13250579,0.00408852,0.014457476,0.14521731,0.004473017,0.003410707,0.004212023,0.012671887,0.002489951,0.004951189,0.025630897,0.008692636,0.005605219,0.004567429,0.01192239,0.0087246,0.002873935,0.003751541,0.001601544,0.006802733,0.004109036,"['beetles', 'dynastes', 'dynastes hercules']","[0.014492753623188002, 0.014492753623188002, 0.014492753623188002]","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0]"

In this study, we examine the effect of arterial three-dimensionality on the distribution of wall shear stress (WSS) and the mass transfer of oxygen from the blood to the vessel wall in a U-bend, by modelling the blood vessels as either cylindrical or helical conduits. The results show that under physiological flow conditions, three-dimensionality can reduce both the range and extent of low WSS regions and substantially increase oxygen flux through the walls. The Sherwood number and WSS distributions between the three-dimensional helical model and a human coronary artery show remarkable qualitative agreement, implying that coronary arteries may potentially be described with a relatively simple idealized three-dimensional model, characterized by a small number of well-defined geometric parameters.

The morphology of the lantern of a specific firefly in the genus Photuris has been examined. The optical properties of the different parts of this lantern have been modelled, in order to determine their positive or adverse effect with regard to the global light extraction.

The current knowledge concerning the most striking feature of mangroves i.e., their unique ability to tolerate high salinity is summarized in the present review. In this review, we shall discuss recent studies that have focused on morphological, anatomical, physiological, biochemical, molecular and genetic attributes associated with the response to salinity, some of which presumably function to mediate salt tolerance in the mangroves. Here we shall also review the major advances recently made at both the genetic and the genomic levels in mangroves. Salinity tolerance in mangroves depends on a range of adaptations, including ion compartmentation, osmoregulation, selective transport and uptake of ions, maintenance of a balance between the supply of ions to the shoot, and capacity to accommodate the salt influx. The tolerance of mangroves to a high saline environment is also tightly linked to the regulation of gene expression. By integrating the information from mangroves and performing comparisons among species of mangroves and non-mangroves, we could give a general picture of salt tolerance mechanisms of mangroves, thus providing a new avenue for development of salt tolerance in crop plants through effective breeding strategies and genetic engineering techniques.",0.025764616,0.005030256,0.01065127,0.020461706,0.015634554,0.011757785,0.00737506,0.008058984,0.013581837,0.005812598,0.79779315,0.010749534,0.014459386,0.004923027,0.007000771,0.022790387,0.00449932,0.006820375,0.014948525,0.012370868,0.01782589,0.012819948,0.06844338,0.010627704,0.009427763,0.010373139,0.008885294,0.009372527,0.005443598,[],[],[]

The epicuticle of the elytra is transparent and about 3 μm thick. Below it is a yellow spongy layer that is usually about 5 μm thick. The cuticle below the yellow sponge is black. When the layer of yellow sponge is air filled it becomes optically heterogeneous, and the light reflected from the elytra is yellow. When the yellow sponge is liquid filled it becomes optically homogeneous, and the black cuticle below is seen. If a beetle that has yellowish elytra is placed in a saturated atmosphere, the elytra become black. When the relative humidity is appreciably reduced, yellow patches begin to appear on the elytra, usually within 30 sec to 2 min. However, if the beetle is kept at a constant relative humidity that previously caused yellowing, it will become black given enough time. Most colour changes observed were clearly in response to changes in the ambient humidity and were not affected when the beetles were kept in the light or in total darkness nor by blackening their eyes or prodding them or exposing them to sounds of different intensities or frequencies. If an elytron is removed from a live beetle, it changes colour in response to changes in relative humidity exactly like the elytron left attached. When a restricted area of the elytra is subjected to a humidity that normally causes blackening and an adjacent area to a humidity that normally causes yellowing, both change colour in the expected way. This local control of colour change seems to preclude hormonal control. It is suggested that the epidermal cells or both the epidermal and blood cells in the elytra are responsible for the hydration and dehydration of the layer of yellow sponge.",0.011535449,0.01234204,0.006117882,0.00513171,0.009011043,0.007106054,0.004619718,0.005999136,0.01969368,0.010736369,0.007717529,0.009402809,0.010880824,0.006641242,0.006199914,0.011273937,0.005783122,0.70121753,0.010703246,0.010545488,0.013584898,0.00967781,0.021979066,0.007707279,0.00667781,0.007859205,0.007621286,0.02014746,0.007020555,['vicia faba'],[0.019230769230769003],[1.0]

G. multifolia is threatened in its natural habitat and resides in the ‘Vulnerable’ category of the ‘Red Data List of Southern African Plants’. Previous investigations suggested that G. multifolia is more sensitive to drought stress than G. villosa and that both species adopted certain morphological changes in their leaves during shade stress. Current models indicate that this biome is being exposed to increasingly drier conditions and shading from encroaching indigenous plant species. In this study, the photosynthetic gas exchange responses of both species to drought and shade stresses were investigated and the ‘Vulnerable’ conservation status of G. multifolia. This investigation found that during drought stress G. villosa had a more enhanced photosynthetic performance than G. multifolia which appears not to be related to foliar adaptations such as specific leaf mass (SLM), but to the G. villosa's leaves maintaining their stomatal conductance (Gs), photosynthetic light compensation (LCP) and photon yields. Furthermore, during shade stress G. villosa also had an improved photosynthetic performance by not altering its photosynthetic LCP during reduced light conditions. It can be concluded that G. multifolia has a lower capacity than G. villosa to adapt its photosynthetic apparatus to changing environments such as increasing drought and shaded conditions.

Hence, it is surprising that spider silk proteins can be stored in a soluble form at high concentrations and transformed into extremely stable fibres on demand. Silk proteins are reminiscent of amphiphilic block copolymers containing stretches of polyalanine and glycine-rich polar elements forming a repetitive core flanked by highly conserved non-repetitive amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal domains. The N-terminal domain comprises a secretion signal, but further functions remain unassigned. The C-terminal domain was implicated in the control of solubility and fibre formation initiated by changes in ionic composition and mechanical stimuli known to align the repetitive sequence elements and promote β-sheet formation. However, despite recent structural data, little is known about this remarkable behaviour in molecular detail. Here we present the solution structure of the C-terminal domain of a spider dragline silk protein and provide evidence that the structural state of this domain is essential for controlled switching between the storage and assembly forms of silk proteins.

The wingbeat kinematics were recorded by high-speed filming and the wake of the bird was visualized by digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV). Certain flight characteristics of the swift differ from those of previously studied species. As the flight speed increases, the angular velocity of the wingbeat remains constant, and so as the wingbeat amplitude increases, the frequency decreases accordingly, as though the flight muscles were contracting at a fixed rate. The wings are also comparatively inflexible and are flexed or retracted rather little during the upstroke. The upstroke is always aerodynamically active and this is reflected in the wake, where shedding of spanwise vorticity occurs throughout the wingbeat. Although the wake superficially resembles those of other birds in cruising flight, with a pair of trailing wingtip vortices connected by spanwise vortices, the continuous shedding of first positive vorticity during the downstroke and then negative vorticity during the upstroke suggests a wing whose circulation is gradually increasing and then decreasing during the wingbeat cycle. The wake (and implied wing aerodynamics) are not well described by discrete vortex loop models, but a new wake-based model, where incremental spanwise and streamwise variations of the wake impulse are integrated over the wingbeat, shows good agreement of the vertical momentum flux with the required weight support. The total drag was also estimated from the wake alone, and the calculated lift:drag ratio of approximately 13 for flapping flight is the highest measured yet for birds.",0.010133549,0.012643604,0.01892044,0.009545689,0.02006718,0.024725938,0.015756428,0.007009252,0.014999573,0.00820656,0.005139199,0.008443088,0.012259416,0.019395137,0.009043765,0.005539348,0.8487086,0.01098342,0.010044077,0.025841894,0.019040378,0.016436238,0.02913998,0.012208621,0.00967977,0.010483871,0.006327189,0.006379637,0.017239716,[],[],[]

Plugging is triggered by Ca(2+) which induces an anisotropic deformation of forisomes, consisting of a longitudinal contraction and a radial expansion. By conventional light microscopy and confocal laser-scanning microscopy, the three-dimensional geometry of the forisome-sieve element-sieve plate complex in intact sieve tubes of leaflets of Vicia faba L. was reconstructed. Forisomes were mostly located close to sieve plates, and occasionally were observed drifting unrestrainedly along the sieve element, suggesting that they might be utilized as internal markers of flow direction. The diameter of forisomes in the resting state correlated with the diameter of their sieve elements, supporting the idea that radial expansion of forisomes is the geometric basis of reversible sieve tube plugging.

The leaf rosettes of the carnivorous Pinguicula moranensis follow a spiral phyllotaxis approaching a Fibonacci pattern while the stalked flowers arise from extra-axillary sites between the leaves. The organization of this rosette has been discussed by various authors, with various results. The aim of the present study was to clarify the development of the flowering rosettes of this species.


METHODS
The formation of the rosettes is shown with the aid of scanning electron microscopy.


KEY RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The scanning electron micrographs show that each flower terminates an article (sympodial unit). The leaves of consecutive articles of such sympodially constructed rosettes are arranged along a spiral Fibonacci pattern (with divergence angles around 137 degrees). This results from homodromy of leaf initiation in consecutive articles with the first leaf (prophyll) of a new article inserted in an obliquely transverse position next to the floral scape that terminates the former article. Sympodial construction of flowering shoots and leaf rosettes is also known from Aloe, Gunnera and Philodendron. As a by-product of this study, the unidirectional development of the Pinguicula flower is confirmed and discussed.",0.02645968,0.007270005,0.54211223,0.00542375,0.011194899,0.003639566,0.007142045,0.014516766,0.05793539,0.007768729,0.007049946,0.007622119,0.009294878,0.007345204,0.01790031,0.011596717,0.007535018,0.003344556,0.005109823,0.004521226,0.003445084,0.008832415,0.00599832,0.26048353,0.00658389,0.003934303,0.002604943,0.007472443,0.006224419,"['cladosporium sphaerospermum', 'exophiala lecanii-corni']","[0.011764705882352, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0]"

Five fungal species, Cladosporium resinae (ATCC 34066), Cladosporium sphaerospermum (ATCC 200384), Exophiala lecanii-corni (CBS 102400), Mucor rouxii (ATCC 44260), and Phanerochaete chrysosporium (ATCC 24725), were tested for their ability to degrade nine compounds commonly found in industrial off-gas emissions. Fungal cultures inoculated on ceramic support media were provided with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) via the vapor phase as their sole carbon and energy sources. Compounds tested included aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene, and styrene), ketones (methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, and methyl propyl ketone), and organic acids (n-butyl acetate, ethyl 3-ethoxypropionate). Experiments were conducted using three pH values ranging from 3.5 to 6.5. Fungal ability to degrade each VOC was determined by observing the presence or absence of visible growth on the ceramic support medium during a 30-day test period. Results indicate that E. lecanii-corni and C. sphaerospermum can readily utilize each of the nine VOCs as a sole carbon and energy source. P. chrysosporium was able to degrade all VOCs tested except for styrene under the conditions imposed. C. resinae was able to degrade both organic acids, all of the ketones, and some of the aromatic compounds (ethylbenzene and toluene); however, it was not able to grow utilizing benzene or styrene under the conditions tested. With the VOCs tested, M. rouxii produced visible growth only when supplied with n-butyl acetate or ethyl 3-ethoxypropionate. Maximum growth for most fungi was observed at a pH of approximately 5.0.

To understand this propulsion process, we quantified the water movements and displacements resulting from swimming in the green frog Rana esculenta, applying digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) to the frog's wake. The wake showed two vortex rings left behind by the two feet. The rings appeared to be elliptic in planform, urging for correction of the observed ring radii. The rings' long and short axes (average ratio 1.75:1) were about the same size as the length and width of the propelling frog foot and the ellipsoid mass of water accelerated with it. Average thrust forces were derived from the vortex rings, assuming all propulsive energy to be compiled in the rings. The calculated average forces (Fav=0.10±0.04 N) were in close agreement with our parallel study applying a momentum–impulse approach to water displacements during the leg extension phase. We did not find any support for previously assumed propulsion enhancement mechanisms. The feet do not clap together at the end of the power stroke and no `wedge-action' jetting is observed.

We hypothesized that this feeding environment might promote nutrient acquisition by the branchial and epidermal epithelia. The potential for Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus stoutii, to absorb amino acids from the environment across the skin and gill was thus investigated. l-alanine and glycine were absorbed via specific transport pathways across both gill and skin surfaces, the first such documentation of direct organic nutrient acquisition in a vertebrate animal. Uptake occurred via distinct mechanisms with respect to concentration dependence, sodium dependence and effects of putative transport inhibitors across each epithelium. Significant differences in the absorbed amino acid distribution between the skin of juveniles and adults were noted. The ability to absorb dissolved organic matter across the skin and gill may be an adaptation to a scavenging lifestyle, allowing hagfish to maximize sporadic opportunities for organic nutrient acquisition. From an evolutionary perspective, hagfish represent a transitory state between the generalized nutrient absorption pathways of aquatic invertebrates and the more specialized digestive systems of aquatic vertebrates.",0.04440507,0.008573739,0.01356035,0.009835594,0.022521663,0.007521042,0.005617349,0.026043935,0.018867647,0.022938304,0.017091854,0.02945377,0.01479082,0.026727553,0.013065668,0.014239329,0.011992284,0.022205535,0.8811426,0.008591783,0.024408223,0.012670382,0.020498931,0.007347287,0.009966175,0.013998518,0.007935276,0.014801538,0.00944943,"['beetles', 'uloborus walckenaerius']","[0.013157894736842, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0]"

For most species, tail loss is followed by the equally dramatic phenomenon of tail regeneration. Here we review the anatomy and histology of caudal autotomy and regeneration in lizards, drawing heavily from research published over the past 2 decades. The autotomous tail is characterized by various structural adaptations, which act to minimize blood loss and trauma to adjacent tissues. The early phase of wound healing involves a leukocytic response but limited inflammation. Reepithelialization via a specialized wound epithelium is not only critical for scar-free healing but also necessary for subsequent tissue patterning and regenerative outgrowth. Regeneration begins with the formation of the blastema, a mass of proliferating mesenchymal-like cells. As the blastema expands, it is invaded by blood vessels and the spinal cord. Whereas the replacement tail outwardly resembles the original appendage, it differs in several notable respects, including the tissue composition and organization of the skeleton, muscular system, and spinal cord. Increasingly, the lizard tail is being recognized among biomedical scientists as an important model for the study of wound healing and multitissue restoration.",0.003704765,0.00252796,0.00788986,0.002913157,0.010430453,0.006749064,0.005558645,0.003229688,0.32409158,0.003932972,0.004430026,0.00502019,0.007222787,0.002623816,0.008711676,0.009654857,0.003506179,0.005156335,0.004967211,0.003215417,0.010982461,0.003090448,0.01075905,0.004437528,0.002037401,0.006577752,0.004266494,0.010674902,0.003698988,[],[],[]

There are two conflicting hypotheses as to the source and biochemical properties of this mucous coating. One hypothesis proposes that anemonefishes acquire anemone substances from their hosts during the behavioral process of acclimation, that protect the fish from being stung. Anemonefishes are considered to use anemone mucus as “chemical camouflage” or “macromolecular mimicry” to avoid recognition as “not-self” by the anemone, and possible subsequent stinging. Another hypothesis is that anemonefishes produce their own protective mucus coat, which lacks substances that elicit cnida (nematocyst and spirocyst) discharge by their hosts. 
 
The present study used immunological techniques to test whether the anemonefish Amphiprion clarkii (Bennett) (which was innately protected from two of the anemones used in the present study) has a mucous coat that resembles the external mucus of anemones. Polyclonal antibodies were prepared to the mucus of four species of anemones [Heteractis crispa, (Ehrenberg) Stichodactyla haddoni (Saville-Kent), Macrodactyla doreenensis (Quoy and Gaimard), and Condylactis gigantea (Weinland)]. Ouchterlony (double immunodiffusion) tests showed that different antigens were present in the mucus of the four anemone species. Anemone antigens were not detected in the mucous coating of either naive (fish that had never before encountered sea anemones) or associated (those living with sea anemones) anemonefishes in Ouchterlony tests. However, more sensitive ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) tests showed that anemone mucus antigens were present in the mucous coating of associated anemonefish, but not naive fish. This showed that an innately protected A. clarkii does not produce a mucus coat that is biochemically similar to that of anemones, but that the same fish does acquire anemone substances in its mucus coat when it associates with anemones in aquaria. It remains to be shown whether these anemone substances actually provide the initial protection for those anemonefishes that must undergo acclimation behavior in order to keep from being stung by their host sea anemones, or additional protection for innately protected fishes.",0.022071939,0.005918844,0.014144486,0.025286483,0.01931634,0.013996556,0.008883972,0.015526393,0.016658336,0.008663851,0.9126905,0.016022606,0.04120952,0.006840307,0.015331825,0.026150506,0.005695534,0.010100728,0.014977855,0.015531606,0.024024695,0.009939496,0.038701013,0.0202677,0.013617544,0.017764566,0.009872978,0.010306252,0.007000473,"['crickets', 'bats']","[0.017543859649122, 0.017543859649122]","[1.0, 1.0]"

One set of subsamples was placed underwater (submersed treatment). Seeds of 20 species germinated and grew in this treatment. On the average, there were 8.3 species/sample. The 2nd set of subsamples was kept moist, simulating conditions on an exposed mud flat (drawdown treatment). In the drawdown treatment, on the average, seeds of 12.9 species germinated/sample. Altogether seeds of 40 species germinated in this treatment of which only 24% were also found in the submersed treatment. By combining the results from the 2 treatments, the seed banks in the 6 vegetation types studied were estimated to range from 21,445 to 42,615 seeds/m2 on the average in the upper 5 cm of soil. Field studies at Eagle Lake (1974) and Goose Lake (1976), when these marshes had no standing water, revealed that the most abundant species whose seeds germinated on exposed mud flats were the same as the most abundant species in the experimental drawdown samples from Eagle Lake. In 1975, when Eagle Lake had standing water again, the submersed and floating species that were found were the same as those found in the experimental submersed samples from Eagle Lake. The seed-bank results and vegetation sampling reveal that there are 3 types of species present in prairie marsh seed banks: emergent species (Typha, Scirpus, Sparganium, Sagittaria) germinate on exposed mud flats or in very shallow water; submersed and free-floating species (Lemna, Spirodela, Ceratophyllum, Naias, Potamogeton) whose dormant seeds or turions can survive on exposed mud flats for a year and which germinate when there is standing water; and mud-flat species (Bidens, Cyperus, Polygonum and Rumex) which are ephemerals whose seeds can only germinate on exposed mud flats during periods when no standing water exists in the marsh because of drought or water level manipulation. When the marsh refloods, these species are eliminated from the visible marsh flora. Primarily because of fluctuating water levels and muskrat damage, prairie marshes have cyclical changes in their vegetation during which mud-flat, emergent, or submersed and free-floating species replace each other as the dominant type of species in a marsh.",0.036087558,0.00773775,0.010458412,0.010578821,0.005690964,0.004600421,0.007198684,0.016133515,0.016160354,0.01234287,0.03327282,0.370106,0.005081524,0.0189016,0.009039814,0.1070182,0.005093694,0.01378622,0.29826927,0.013777678,0.012447274,0.021016724,0.071984924,0.00898531,0.007798507,0.005577317,0.005435546,0.017958479,0.006189572,"['colletes', 'bee', 'bees']","[0.03125, 0.09375000000000001, 0.03125]","[0.33333333333333304, 1.0, 0.33333333333333304]"

An intriguing example is provided by desert beetles, which use micrometre-sized patterns of hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions on their backs to capture water from humid air. As anyone who has admired spider webs adorned with dew drops will appreciate, spider silk is also capable of efficiently collecting water from air. Here we show that the water-collecting ability of the capture silk of the cribellate spider Uloborus walckenaerius is the result of a unique fibre structure that forms after wetting, with the ‘wet-rebuilt’ fibres characterized by periodic spindle-knots made of random nanofibrils and separated by joints made of aligned nanofibrils. These structural features result in a surface energy gradient between the spindle-knots and the joints and also in a difference in Laplace pressure, with both factors acting together to achieve continuous condensation and directional collection of water drops around spindle-knots. Submillimetre-sized liquid drops have been driven by surface energy gradients or a difference in Laplace pressure, but until now neither force on its own has been used to overcome the larger hysteresis effects that make the movement of micrometre-sized drops more difficult. By tapping into both driving forces, spider silk achieves this task. Inspired by this finding, we designed artificial fibres that mimic the structural features of silk and exhibit its directional water-collecting ability.",0.03881773,0.011156947,0.010118546,0.013071916,0.016653681,0.00781978,0.008524161,0.021124229,0.007604387,0.037841473,0.010660022,0.013613566,0.01727703,0.011641172,0.012328283,0.01737607,0.007435408,0.011578056,0.023842374,0.012844054,0.011775173,0.00320754,0.009491494,0.015630687,0.029752847,0.012125567,0.03827645,0.8323031,0.010975751,"['plants', 'nelumbo nucifera']","[0.011627906976744, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0]"

Sutures oriented circumferentially are subject principally to compression. Those forming radial zig-zags are subject to compression near the apex and tension near the ambitus. Radial and circumferential sutures in Eucidaris are equally bound with collagen fibers but in Diadema, Tripneustes, Psammechinus, Arbacia and other regular echinoids, most radial sutures are more heavily bound, and thus stronger in tension. Psammechinus, Tripneustes and several other echinoids have radial sutures thickened by ribs which increase the area of interlocking trabeculae. Ribs also increase flexural stiffness and carry a greater proportion of the stress. Further, ribs effectively draw stress from weaker areas pierced by podial pores, and increase the total load which can be sustained.Allometry indicates that regular echinoids become relatively higher at the apex as size increases, thus reducing ambital stresses. Some spatangoids with very high domes (eg Agassizia) maintain isometry, but others (eg Meoma) become flatter with size. Both holectypoids (Echinoneus) and cassiduloids (Apatopygus) maintain a constant height to diameter relationship. Flattening, and consequently ambital tensile stress, is greatest in the clypeasteroids. In this group the formation of internal buttresses which preferentially carry stress, reaches maximum development. A notable exception, however, is the high domed Clypeaster rosaceus.In this analysis it was assumed that local buckling or bending does not occur. The test of some echinoids (e.g. Diadematoida) have relatively wide sutures swathed in collagen, which allows local deformation. Others (e.g. Arbacia) have rigid sutures with reduced collagen. In Psammechinus and other members of the Order Echinoida, in addition to rib formation, inner and outer surface trabeculae are thickened so that the individual plates are stiffened. Some spatangoids (Meoma, Paleopneustes) have extensive sutural collagen, but the cassiduloid Apatopygus has collagen confined to junctions of sutures, and elsewhere the joints are strengthened and stiffened by fusion of trabeculae. Fusion of surface trabeculae is almost complete in the holectypoid, Echinoneus, and the sutures are obscured.",0.008333284,0.015957953,0.011426793,0.006584997,0.8671932,0.020840136,0.027976526,0.012592186,0.01546817,0.026536092,0.009789624,0.005711968,0.013800023,0.009210889,0.046099532,0.011521919,0.014137239,0.013235109,0.010109699,0.009381319,0.01650111,0.014456919,0.011576228,0.013689457,0.08061611,0.018635962,0.9072498,0.024910806,0.015605453,"['alcedo', 'alcedo atthis', 'atthis', 'common kingfisher']","[0.017241379310344, 0.017241379310344, 0.017241379310344, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0]"

Experiments conducted on a simulation model of the system indicated that the mechanism output a directional signal to sounds ahead at calling song frequency and to sounds behind at echolocation frequencies.

Five offspring of this variety, from 200–500-year-old fruits (14C dates) collected at Xipaozi, have recently been germinated, and are the first such seedlings to be raised from directly dated fruits. The fruits at Xipaozi, preserved in a dry ancient lakebed, have been exposed to low-dose γ-radiation for hundreds of years (having an accumulated soil irradiation of 0.1–1.0 Gy). Offspring from these old fruits show abnormalities that resemble those in various modern seedlings irradiated at much higher doses. Although these lotus offspring are phenotypically abnormal, the viability of old seeds was evidently not affected by accumulated doses of up to 3 Gy. Growth characteristics of first- and second-year lotus offspring of these fruits, products of the longest-term radiobiological experiment on record, are summarized here (rapid early growth, phenotypic abnormalities, lack of vigour, poor rhizome development and low photosynthetic activity during second-year growth). Aspects of their chromosomal organization, phenotype and physiology (rapid recovery from stress, heat-stable proteins, protein-repair enzyme) are discussed. Important unsolved problems are suggested to elicit interest among members of the seed science community to the study of old fruits recently collected at Xipaozi, with particular emphasis on aspects of ageing and repair.",0.004920089,0.005023566,0.004434285,0.004057489,0.005294851,0.002906565,0.00338684,0.010701484,0.032716673,0.006251883,0.010474382,0.28562263,0.004210671,0.004341774,0.005776406,0.0234595,0.002051211,0.011938746,0.058784563,0.004060494,0.011890335,0.008359589,0.015934085,0.008857041,0.004825472,0.007044804,0.004286917,0.01485177,0.005404459,['human immunodeficiency virus'],[0.0],[0]

Scanning electron microscopy showed that the orange barbs contain small pigment granules. The cyan and blue barbs contain spongy nanostructures with slightly different dimensions, causing different reflectance spectra. Imaging scatterometry showed that the pigmented barbs create a diffuse orange scattering and the spongy barb structures create iridescence. The extent of the angle-dependent light scattering increases with decreasing wavelength. All barbs have a cortical envelope with a thickness of a few micrometres. The reflectance spectra of the cortex of the barbs show oscillations when measured from small areas, but when measured from larger areas the spectra become wavelength independent. This can be directly understood with thin film modelling, assuming a somewhat variable cortex thickness.

Whether ice-dwelling organisms can change those properties has rarely been addressed. Following discovery that sea ice contains an abundance of gelatinous extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), we examined the effects of algal EPS on the microstructure and salt retention of ice grown from saline solutions containing EPS from a culture of the sea-ice diatom, Melosira arctica. We also experimented with xanthan gum and with EPS from a culture of the cold-adapted bacterium Colwellia psychrerythraea strain 34H. Quantitative microscopic analyses of the artificial ice containing Melosira EPS revealed convoluted ice-pore morphologies of high fractal dimension, mimicking features found in EPS-rich coastal sea ice, whereas EPS-free (control) ice featured much simpler pore geometries. A heat-sensitive glycoprotein fraction of Melosira EPS accounted for complex pore morphologies. Although all tested forms of EPS increased bulk ice salinity (by 11–59%) above the controls, ice containing native Melosira EPS retained the most salt. EPS effects on ice and pore microstructure improve sea ice habitability, survivability, and potential for increased primary productivity, even as they may alter the persistence and biogeochemical imprint of sea ice on the surface ocean in a warming climate.",0.009311539,0.01012608,0.032639522,0.014853111,0.018471176,0.019524027,0.009877117,0.041178025,0.8798603,0.023615226,0.013641409,0.83690935,0.008561746,0.008642156,0.014571449,0.02975624,0.010371807,0.020275272,0.027190205,0.023685137,0.020340085,0.03421436,0.02632852,0.027443225,0.007136353,0.02048976,0.007889581,0.018362159,0.016798677,['anthozoans'],[0.009900990099009],[1.0]

First, neurobiotin and Janus green B staining techniques are used to describe a novel mesothoracic chordotonal organ in the hawkmoth, Manduca sexta, which is shown to be serially homologous to the noctuoid metathoracic tympanal organ. This chordotonal organ comprises a proximal scolopidial region with three bipolar sensory cells, and a long flexible strand (composed of attachment cells) that connects peripherally to an unspecialized membrane ventral to the axillary cord of the fore-wing. Homology to the tympanal chordotonal organ in the Noctuoidea is proposed from anatomical comparisons of the meso- and metathoracic nerve branches and their corresponding peripheral attachment sites. Second, the general structure (noting sensory cell numbers, gross anatomy, and location of peripheral attachment sites) of both meso- and metathoracic organs is surveyed in 23 species representing seven superfamilies of the Lepidoptera. The structure of the wing-hinge chordotonal organ in both thoracic segments was found to be remarkably conserved in all superfamilies of the Macrolepidoptera examined except the Noctuoidea, where fewer than three cells occur in the metathoracic ear (one cell in representatives of the Notodontidae and two cells in those of other families examined), and at the mesothoracic wing-hinge (two cells) in the Notodontidae only. By mapping cell numbers onto current phylogenies of the Macrolepidoptera, we demonstrate that the three-celled wing-hinge chordotonal organ, believed to be a wing proprioceptor, represents the plesiomorphic state from which the tympanal organ in the Noctuoidea evolved. This ’trend toward simplicity’ in the noctuoid ear contrasts an apparent ’trend toward complexity’ in several other insect hearing organs where atympanate homologues have been studied. The advantages to having fewer rather than more cells in the moth ear, which functions primarily to detect the echolocation calls of bats, is discussed.",0.011277372,0.017109934,0.004433193,0.027599247,0.004383666,0.006236541,0.00283214,0.002086969,0.005886602,0.007428447,0.002931853,0.003366997,0.008282134,0.007957044,0.009899775,0.001660458,0.01382297,0.005940641,0.003895729,0.003088222,0.005349342,0.077392876,0.007548191,0.002968223,0.003299222,0.005519182,0.003302137,0.003512465,0.004006212,[],[],[]

The HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) uses its RNase H activity to cut the genomic RNA after minus strand DNA synthesis. A plus strand PPT primer is formed, extended, and then removed. In vitro, the HIV-RT recognizes this primer specifically, using it much more efficiently than other RNA primers. However, the PPT still primes significantly less efficiently than DNA primers. The 19-nucleotide PPT primer is partially resistant to degradation when compared with other oligoribonucleotides. Prior to initiation of DNA synthesis, several nucleotides are removed by the RT from the 3′ ends of some of the PPT primers. Cleavage is enhanced in the absence of dNTPs. We suggest that DNA synthesis suppresses primer degradation, so that primer extension and cleavage occur in proper sequence. As a result of 3′ end degradation, PPT elongation products contain 5′-RNA segments from 16 to 19 nucleotides in length. These shorter segments are also generated from a longer transcript containing the PPT sequence, indicating that they are not created as a result of binding of the RT to the 5′ end of the PPT oligoribonucleotide. Full-length and shorter versions of the PPT primers are cleaved from the extended DNA by RT.

Upregulation of FP's frequently occurs in injured or compromised coral tissue, suggesting a potential role of coral FPs in host stress responses. Methodology/Principal Findings The presence of FPs was determined and quantified for a subsample of seven healthy Caribbean coral species using spectral emission analysis of tissue extracts. FP concentration was correlated with the in vivo antioxidant potential of the tissue extracts by quantifying the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) scavenging rates. FPs of the seven species varied in both type and abundance and demonstrated a positive correlation between H2O2 scavenging rate and FP concentration. To validate this data, the H2O2 scavenging rates of four pure scleractinian FPs, cyan (CFP), green (GFP), red (RFP) and chromoprotein (CP), and their mutant counterparts (without chromophores), were investigated. In vitro, each FP scavenged H2O2 with the most efficient being CP followed by equivalent activity of CFP and RFP. Scavenging was significantly higher in all mutant counterparts. Conclusions/Significance Both naturally occurring and pure coral FPs have significant H2O2 scavenging activity. The higher scavenging rate of RFP and the CP in vitro is consistent with observed increases of these specific FPs in areas of compromised coral tissue. However, the greater scavenging ability of the mutant counterparts suggests additional roles of scleractinian FPs, potentially pertaining to their color. This study documents H2O2 scavenging of scleractinian FPs, a novel biochemical characteristic, both in vivo across multiple species and in vitro with purified proteins. These data support a role for FPs in coral stress and immune responses and highlights the multi-functionality of these conspicuous proteins.",0.009720348,0.003552977,0.003367185,0.010393478,0.006475105,0.00589104,0.003983997,0.007861633,0.006315125,0.003900027,0.35847753,0.008560896,0.023759166,0.003504298,0.004705122,0.009900097,0.002751794,0.009091449,0.008125962,0.008124366,0.008426983,0.004797714,0.007022583,0.008269603,0.005326753,0.04019458,0.004334034,0.00992669,0.003145695,"['gaidropsarus', 'atlantic puffin', 'fish', 'puffin', 'crustacea', 'puffins', 'gaidropsarus argentatus', 'ammodytes marinus', 'ammodytes']","[0.014084507042253001, 0.0, 0.056338028169014, 0.04225352112676, 0.028169014084507, 0.04225352112676, 0.014084507042253001, 0.0, 0.014084507042253001]","[0.25, 0.0, 1.0, 0.75, 0.5, 0.75, 0.25, 0.0, 0.25]"

A test of the skills hypothesis in the cooperatively displaying lance-tailed manakin.,"Experience improves individual performance in many tasks. Pre-breeding cooperation may provide important experience that improves later success as a breeder, offering one compelling explanation for why some individuals delay reproduction to help others breed (the 'skills hypothesis'). However, confounding effects of age, quality and alternative selective benefits have complicated rigorous tests of this hypothesis. Male lance-tailed manakins perform cooperative courtship displays involving partnerships between unrelated alpha and beta males, and alphas monopolize resulting copulations. Beta males therefore do not receive immediate direct or indirect fitness benefits, but may gain skills during cooperation that increase their later success as an alpha. To date, however, the effect of cooperative experience on later success as a breeder has never been tested in any cooperatively displaying taxon. The effects of prior cooperative experience on reproductive success of alpha lance-tailed manakins were analysed in a mixed model framework using 12 years of information on cooperative experience and annual and lifetime genetic reproductive success for 57 alpha males. Models included previously identified effects of age and alpha tenure. Individual-level random effects controlled for quality differences to test for an independent influence of beta experience on success. Males accumulated up to 5 years of beta experience before becoming alphas, but 42·1% of alphas had no prior beta experience. Betas became alphas later in life, and experienced significantly lower reproductive success in their final year as alpha than males that were never beta, but did not have higher lifetime success or longer alpha tenures. Differences in patterns of annual siring success were best explained by age-dependent patterns of reproductive improvement and senescence among alphas, not beta experience. Cooperative experience does not increase relative breeding success for male lance-tailed manakins. Importantly, beta cooperation seems to be an alternative reproductive tactic that yields fitness payoffs equivalent to a non-cooperative route to alpha status, if population growth rate is stable.",0.009345431,0.004885642,0.023355283,0.01886756,0.006300772,0.00960575,0.003509593,0.004214741,0.0127626,0.2789586,0.005903587,0.027639082,0.004425724,0.011305159,0.005801025,0.005011055,0.006564249,0.006821321,0.011663725,0.005128963,0.002613436,0.13624924,0.007126758,0.01551221,0.005026022,0.006823373,0.004173396,0.004900294,0.007815966,"['humans', 'drosophila melanogaster', 'melanogaster', 'drosophila']","[0.014705882352941001, 0.014705882352941001, 0.014705882352941001, 0.029411764705882002]","[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0]"

Although the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster tastes sugars, salts and noxious chemicals, the nature and number of taste modalities in this organism is not clear. Previous studies have identified one taste cell population marked by the gustatory receptor gene Gr5a that detects sugars, and a second population marked by Gr66a that detects bitter compounds. Here we identify a novel taste modality in this insect: the taste of carbonated water. We use a combination of anatomical, calcium imaging and behavioural approaches to identify a population of taste neurons that detects CO2 and mediates taste acceptance behaviour. The taste of carbonation may allow Drosophila to detect and obtain nutrients from growing microorganisms. Whereas CO2 detection by the olfactory system mediates avoidance, CO2 detection by the gustatory system mediates acceptance behaviour, demonstrating that the context of CO2 determines appropriate behaviour.

One explanation for the stability of the LEV is that spiraling axial flow within the vortex core drains energy into the tip vortex, forming a leading-edge spiral vortex analogous to the flow structure generated by delta wing aircraft. However, whereas spiral flow is a conspicuous feature of flapping wings at Reynolds numbers (Re) of 5000, similar experiments at Re=100 failed to identify a comparable structure. We used a dynamically scaled robot to investigate both the forces and the flows created by a wing undergoing identical motion at Re of∼ 120 and ∼1400. In both cases, motion at constant angular velocity and fixed angle of attack generated a stable LEV with no evidence of shedding. At Re=1400, flow visualization indicated an intense narrow region of spanwise flow within the core of the LEV, a feature conspicuously absent at Re=120. The results suggest that the transport of vorticity from the leading edge to the wake that permits prolonged vortex attachment takes different forms at different Re.",0.010228733,0.011976746,0.016820688,0.010383913,0.020156166,0.025021913,0.016620347,0.007406053,0.012716582,0.00857639,0.005187968,0.008197964,0.013122537,0.023018304,0.009619723,0.005856331,0.8683738,0.011889467,0.012211629,0.02256024,0.020429766,0.018278377,0.024330111,0.013130815,0.009832201,0.01023859,0.007672879,0.006947647,0.02012736,[],[],[]

Nature has accomplished this feat through the precise control of anisotropic crystal nucleation and growth processes in conjunction with nanoscale control over the self-assembly of spatially distinct organic and inorganic phases, resulting in effective inhibition of crack propagation through these materials. One such example is found in the hyper-mineralized and abrasion resistant radular teeth of the chitons, a group of herbivorous marine mollusks who have the surprising capacity to erode away the rocky substrates on which they graze 1-4 . Through the use of modern microscopy and nanomechanical characterization techniques, we describe the architectural and mechanical properties of the radular teeth from Cryptochiton stelleri. Chiton teeth are shown to exhibit the largest hardness and stiffness of any biominerals reported to date, being notably as much as three-fold harder than human enamel and the calcium carbonate-based shells of mollusks.

The directed-deterrence hypothesis states that SMs in ripe fruits deter seed predators but have little or no effect on seed dispersers. Indeed, studies have demonstrated that birds are able to cope with fruit SMs whereas rodents are deterred by them. However, this mechanism was only demonstrated at the class level, i.e., between birds and mammals, based on differences in the vanilloid receptors. Here we present experimental and behavioral data demonstrating the use of the broad-range, class-independent ""mustard oil bomb"" mechanism in Ochradenus baccatus fruits to force a behavioral change at an ecological timescale, converting rodents from seed predators to seed dispersers. This is achieved by a unique compartmentalization of the mustard oil bomb, causing activation of the system only upon seed and pulp coconsumption, encouraging seed dispersal via seed spitting by rodents.

That this should have happened in birds of arid zones is not surprising; what is not immediately obvious is how it happened. The first documented accounts of water transport in sandgrouse are of captive males carrying water in their belly feathers to their young (Meade-Waldo 1896, 1897, 1906, 1921, St. Quintin 1905).

The Arapaimas lives primarily in Amazon basin lakes that become infested with piranhas as the dry season advances and is covered with scales having up to 10 cm length. They have a collagen interior with a highly mineralized external layer. The collagen fibers form a cross-lamellar arrangement which produces a laminate composite. The internal collagenous layer provides the flexibility to the scales, which can undergo significant elastic deformation prior to failure, providing considerable toughness. The mineralized exterior provides the required protection against predation. The flexibility of the biomineral is enabled by two factors: (i) a corrugated configuration in which the tensile strains are minimized; (ii) a graded composition. We propose herein that the structure of the scales, a composite consisting of a mineralized external layer with surface corrugations and an internal flexible collagenous foundation, can serve as inspiration for the design of flexible composites having a hard ceramic surface. The piranha (Serrasalminae) is one of the principal predators in seasonal lakes, in which fish get trapped. Its teeth form triangular arrays creating a guillotine action that is highly effective in slicing through muscle. The bite force is calculated for a piranha with a mass of 1 kg from estimated maximum force values applied by three muscle groups connecting the jaw to the mandible: it is ≈20 N. Mechanical tests on the scales and teeth demonstrate that the cutting and puncturing ability of the piranha teeth cannot penetrate the Arapaimas scales.",0.010269553,0.032077234,0.007276164,0.013440623,0.025455259,0.014312691,0.024872283,0.009454023,0.006046826,0.015863508,0.010373971,0.009324141,0.026050672,0.009632206,0.016824836,0.007042723,0.014475656,0.011675032,0.008636315,0.010088396,0.020196196,0.010849242,0.016585033,0.011801799,0.5483557,0.017819623,0.7918358,0.06939616,0.03221394,[],[],[]

It is proposed that the skin barrier, i.e., the intercellular lipid within the stratum corneum, exists as a single and coherent lamellar gel phase. This membrane structure is stabilized by the very particular lipid composition and lipid chain length distributions of the stratum corneum intercellular space and has virtually no phase boundaries. The intact, i.e., unperturbed, single and coherent lamellar gel phase is proposed to be mainly located at the lower half of stratum corneum. Further up, crystalline segregation and phase separation may occur as a result of the desquamation process. The single gel phase model differs significantly from earlier models in that it predicts that no phase separation, neither between liquid crystalline and gel phases nor between different crystalline phases with hexagonal and orthorhombic chain packing, respectively, is present in the unperturbed barrier structure. The new skin barrier model may explain: (i) the measured water permeability of stratum corneum; (ii) the particular lipid composition of the stratum corneum intercellular space; (iii) the absence of swelling of the stratum corneum intercellular lipid matrix upon hydration; and (iv) the simultaneous presence of hexagonal and orthorhombic hydrocarbon chain packing of the stratum corneum intercellular lipid matrix at physiologic temperatures.

The sessile caddisfly larva Leucotrichia pictipes is territorial and aggressively eliminates conspecifics and other species from its foraging territories. Territoriality produces an intraspecific pattern of regular spacing and negative spatial associations between Leucotrichia and several other sessile insects: Parargyractis confusalis, Rheotanytarsus sp. and Eukiefferiella sp. Experimental removals of Leucotrichia resulted in higher densities of other sessile species and several mobile insects, including Baetis, Glossosoma, and Simulium. These insects show broad microhabitat overlap with Leucotrichia; competition with Leucotrichia limits their dis- tributions and abundances within otherwise suitable microhabitats. Leucotrichia is the only species that monopolizes large areas of space. Physical disturbances interrupt the formation of competitive monopolies by Leucotrichia. During seasonal reduced flows, Leucotrichia is eliminated from stones and boulders in shallow water. Greater densities of a short-lived sessile species with multiple annual generations occupy this ephemeral spatial resource. On permanently submerged stones, Leucotrichia competitively affects a large part of the benthic fauna. On small stones that overturn with higher frequencies during flooding, Leucotrichia densities are reduced and species' abundances are highly equitable.

This has been of interest in the pharmaceutical sciences in order to enhance localised drug delivery, or to deliver 'difficult' molecules (proteins and oligonucleotides) into the systemic circulation. Mucoadhesive materials are hydrophilic macromolecules containing numerous hydrogen bond forming groups, the carbomers and chitosans being two well-known examples. The mechanism by which mucoadhesion takes place has been said to have two stages, the contact (wetting) stage followed by the consolidation stage (the establishment of the adhesive interactions). The relative importance of each stage will depend on the individual application. For example, adsorption is a key stage if the dosage form cannot be applied directly to the mucosa of interest, while consolidation is important if the formulation is exposed to significant dislodging stresses. Adhesive joint failure will inevitably occur as a result of overhydration of a dosage form, or as a result of epithelia or mucus turnover. New mucoadhesive materials with optimal adhesive properties are now being developed, and these should enhance the potential applications of this technology.",0.015200936,0.004879732,0.006745034,0.013922108,0.01154812,0.00353062,0.005781055,0.004223712,0.003595193,0.3102271,0.008370628,0.005115607,0.013940588,0.01997765,0.025342345,0.008513291,0.005553199,0.007968823,0.02094208,0.005374538,0.008153368,0.005870782,0.004927867,0.005136499,0.012350191,0.069194086,0.006953094,0.12663588,0.007001411,"['salticidae', 'insects', 'anopheles', 'culicivora']","[0.013698630136986, 0.013698630136986, 0.068493150684931, 0.041095890410958]","[0.2, 0.2, 1.0, 0.6000000000000001]"

From a functional perspective, the weight (mass) of an animal relative to its lift-generating surfaces is a key determinant of the metabolic cost of flight. The evolution of birds has been characterized by many weight-saving adaptations that are reflected in bone shape, many of which strengthen and stiffen the skeleton. Although largely unstudied in birds, the material properties of bone tissue can also contribute to bone strength and stiffness. In this study, I calculated the density of the cranium, humerus and femur in passerine birds, rodents and bats by measuring bone mass and volume using helium displacement. I found that, on average, these bones are densest in birds, followed closely by bats. As bone density increases, so do bone stiffness and strength. Both of these optimization criteria are used in the design of strong and stiff, but lightweight, manmade airframes. By analogy, increased bone density in birds and bats may reflect adaptations for maximizing bone strength and stiffness while minimizing bone mass and volume. These data suggest that both bone shape and the material properties of bone tissue have played important roles in the evolution of flight. They also reconcile the conundrum of how bird skeletons can appear to be thin and delicate, yet contribute just as much to total body mass as do the skeletons of terrestrial mammals.",0.010045889,0.007738694,0.012245486,0.006697639,0.47158432,0.008259743,0.084891655,0.00874302,0.004750423,0.007313395,0.004331632,0.006243906,0.016892979,0.011455566,0.009701725,0.009742736,0.056929275,0.007762023,0.007129693,0.00601522,0.014321379,0.006728634,0.010653239,0.016496947,0.626483,0.010264339,0.17430882,0.008393806,0.013916598,"['angiosperms', 'pteris vittata']","[0.043478260869565, 0.014492753623188002]","[1.0, 0.33333333333333304]"

We studied monarch butterflies and their virulent protozoan parasites, and found that neither caterpillars nor adult butterflies could cure themselves of disease. Instead, adult butterflies preferentially laid their eggs on toxic plants that reduced parasite growth and disease in their offspring caterpillars. It has often been suggested that sick animals may use medication to cure themselves of disease, but evidence for the use of medication in nature has so far been scarce.

Fibrous keratins evolved as a means of strengthening the integument while simultaneously providing a structural support for lipids, which comprise the principal barrier to cutaneous water efflux in terrestrial taxa. Whereas lipids are of fundamental importance to water barriers, the efficacy of these barriers depends in many cases on structural features that enhance or maintain the integrity of function. Amphibians are exceptional among tetrapods in having very little keratin and a thin stratum corneum. Thus, effective lipid barriers that are present in some specialized anurans living in xeric habitats are external to the epidermis, whereas lipid barriers of amniotes exist as a lipid-keratin complex within the stratum corneum. Amphibians prevent desiccation of the epidermis and underlying tissues either by evaporating water from a superficial aqueous film, which must be replenished, or by shielding the stratum corneum with superficial lipids. Water barrier function in vertebrates generally appears to be relatively fixed, although various species have `plasticity' to adjust the barrier effectiveness facultatively. While it is clear that both phenotypic plasticity and genetic adaptation can account for covariation between environment and skin resistance to water efflux, studies of the relative importance of these two phenomena are few. Fundamental mechanisms for adjusting the skin water barrier include changes in barrier thickness, composition and physicochemical properties of cutaneous lipids, and/or geometry of the barrier within the epidermis. While cutaneous lipids have been studied extensively in the contexts of disease and cosmetics, relatively little is known about the processes of permeability barrier ontogenesis related to adaptation and environment. Advances in such knowledge have didactic significance for understanding vertebrate evolution as well as practical application to clinical dermatology.",0.010959897,0.006837709,0.012723397,0.004159251,0.015416503,0.004475417,0.033925034,0.007936785,0.02651634,0.007866638,0.02498312,0.017493578,0.010864538,0.00837334,0.014893955,0.92287284,0.006501149,0.010897536,0.013034285,0.011595405,0.007047837,0.009707023,0.06239349,0.017179132,0.012713464,0.023672035,0.007198867,0.038846582,0.015520323,"['marina', 'avicennia marina', 'bruguiera cylindrica']","[0.010752688172043001, 0.0, 0.010752688172043001]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0]"

Evarcha culicivora is an East African jumping spider (Salticidae) that feeds indirectly on vertebrate blood by selecting blood-carrying female mosquitoes as preferred prey. Methodology/Principal Findings By testing with motionless lures made from mounting dead insects in lifelike posture on cork discs, we show that E. culicivora selects Anopheles mosquitoes in preference to other mosquitoes and that this predator can identify Anopheles by static appearance alone. Tests using active (grooming) virtual mosquitoes rendered in 3-D animation show that Anopheles' characteristic resting posture is an important prey-choice cue for E. culicivora.

Here we show that the urnulae secrete a waterproofing barrier that reduces the mite's cuticular permeability to water. Exposure to white light was used to stimulate release of the secretion; the urnulae protruded and exuded streams of red fluid at the tip of this structure that covered the entire body. Results showed that mites coated with urnulae secretion lost water at approximately half the rate of mites that did not secrete. Similarly, urnulae secretion coated mites demonstrated an increase in water-tightness of the cuticle reflected by a 9°C elevation in temperature threshold for water loss on an evaporation curve, increasing their optimal temperature tolerance for survival (lethal permeability temperature, LPT). Results also show a 10 kJ/mol drop in activation energy (E a) for water loss, representative of a substantial cuticular modification, and a decrease in Arrhenius frequency steric factor A, indicating an overall decrease in body water losses.

The authors provide evidence that the ACR3 arsenic transporter protein plays an important role in tolerance to high levels of arsenic by transporting arsenic into the vacuole. The fern Pteris vittata tolerates and hyperaccumulates exceptionally high levels of the toxic metalloid arsenic, and this trait appears unique to the Pteridaceae. Once taken up by the root, arsenate is reduced to arsenite as it is transported to the lamina of the frond, where it is stored in cells as free arsenite. Here, we describe the isolation and characterization of two P. vittata genes, ACR3 and ACR3;1, which encode proteins similar to the ACR3 arsenite effluxer of yeast. Pv ACR3 is able to rescue the arsenic-sensitive phenotypes of yeast deficient for ACR3. ACR3 transcripts are upregulated by arsenic in sporophyte roots and gametophytes, tissues that directly contact soil, whereas ACR3;1 expression is unaffected by arsenic. Knocking down the expression of ACR3, but not ACR3;1, in the gametophyte results in an arsenite-sensitive phenotype, indicating that ACR3 plays a necessary role in arsenic tolerance in the gametophyte. We show that ACR3 localizes to the vacuolar membrane in gametophytes, indicating that it likely effluxes arsenite into the vacuole for sequestration. Whereas single-copy ACR3 genes are present in moss, lycophytes, other ferns, and gymnosperms, none are present in angiosperms. The duplication of ACR3 in P. vittata and the loss of ACR3 in angiosperms may explain arsenic tolerance in this unusual group of ferns while precluding the same trait in angiosperms.",0.026215874,0.006929681,0.012109561,0.02612988,0.012773082,0.010445101,0.008609139,0.015696118,0.010299013,0.008730425,0.88376,0.021993123,0.039226465,0.005575128,0.010550121,0.01960824,0.004529326,0.008135591,0.016134612,0.013373892,0.023430094,0.013444126,0.028622812,0.020862048,0.012135131,0.019383451,0.008841967,0.011106223,0.007506704,"['plants', 'higher plants', 'tomato']","[0.012048192771084001, 0.0, 0.024096385542168003]","[0.5, 0.0, 1.0]"

We collected frogs from Pennsylvania during the autumns of 1994 and 1995. All experiments occurred in the laboratory and employed a freezing temperature of -1.5 C. This treatment froze 45% of the body water in these frogs, and they were clearly tolerant of internal freezing. However, their survival was inversely proportional to freeze duration (3 day = 85.0%, 7 day = 52.6%, and 28 day = 0%). Cutaneous blood flow, breathing, hind-leg retraction, righting reflex, and jumping ability returned to surviving frogs within 24-48 h following the conclusion of a 3-day freeze. Complex behavioral responses (e.g., jumping) required more time to return than did basic physiological functions (e.g., cutaneous blood flow). Interestingly, rates of oxygen consumption were not altered during the recovery period with respect to the prefreeze value. This study indicates that the freezing survival of P crucifer is markedly influenced by the duration of the freeze episode, which may be an important ecological limitation during winters having few intervening thaws.

The marine red alga Delisea pulchra produces halogenated furanones which resemble AHLs structurally and show inhibitory activity at ecologically realistic concentrations in AHL bioassays. Evidence is presented that halogenated furanones displace tritiated OHHL [N-3-(oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone] from Escherichia coli cells overproducing LuxR with potencies corresponding to their respective inhibitory activities in an AHL-regulated bioluminescence assay, indicating that this is the mechanism by which furanones inhibit AHL-dependent phenotypes. Alternative mechanisms for this phenomenon are also addressed. General metabolic disruption was assessed with two-dimensional PAGE, revealing limited non-AHL-related effects. A direct chemical interaction between the algal compounds and AHLs, as monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy, was shown not to occur in vitro.

As such, the tissues of reef organisms are often exposed to intense solar radiation in clear tropical waters and have adapted to trap and harness photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). High levels of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) associated with sunlight, however, represent a potential problem in terms of tissue damage. Methodology/Principal Findings By measuring UVR and PAR reflectance from intact and ground bare coral skeletons we show that the property of calcium carbonate skeletons to absorb downwelling UVR to a significant extent, while reflecting PAR back to the overlying tissue, has biological advantages. We placed cnidarians on top of bare skeletons and a UVR reflective substrate and showed that under ambient UVR levels, UVR transmitted through the tissues of cnidarians placed on top of bare skeletons were four times lower compared to their counterparts placed on a UVR reflective white substrate. In accordance with the lower levels of UVR measured in cnidarians on top of coral skeletons, a similar drop in UVR damage to their DNA was detected. The skeletons emitted absorbed UVR as yellow fluorescence, which allows for safe dissipation of the otherwise harmful radiation. Conclusions/Significance Our study presents a novel defensive role for coral skeletons and reveals that the strong UVR absorbance by the skeleton can contribute to the ability of corals, and potentially other calcifiers, to thrive under UVR levels that are detrimental to most marine life.",0.008796354,0.10247718,0.006041535,0.007955971,0.0045003,0.007404103,0.006251269,0.004959018,0.01309129,0.004080934,0.015000206,0.005644799,0.004811508,0.003748197,0.006601106,0.022256453,0.00229038,0.017756464,0.005316753,0.006238143,0.008421694,0.005741078,0.43009675,0.002467599,0.004475895,0.005727218,0.005063336,0.015809018,0.005568921,"['cat', 'aphids', 'insects', 'acyrthosiphon pisum', 'plants', 'pea', 'pea aphid']","[0.05, 0.1, 0.025, 0.0, 0.025, 0.05, 0.05]","[0.5, 1.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5]"

By taking samples along individual branches and measuring leaf size, thickness and Na+ and K+ concentrations, we have shown in Bruguiera cylindrica, Avicennia rumphiana and Avicennia marina that there are two phases of salt accumulation by leaves. This is confirmed by re-analysis of published data for other species. The first phase is a rapid increase in leaf content as it grows from bud to maturity; the second is a slower but continuous change in quantity in the leaf, via changes in ion concentration and/or in leaf thickening. Leaf thickening must not be overlooked in estimating changes in leaf contents with age. Generally, leaf Na+ content increases significantly, and K+ content falls slightly. Mangrove leaves thus continue as sinks for Na+ throughout their lifetime. At the end of a leaf's life, just before abscission, no burst of salt accumulation has been found. Yellow, senescent leaves do not have higher Na+ than old green ones. We point out that leaf drop involves losing both salt and biomass, not just salt, and hence does not reduce the salt concentration in the plant. We conclude that leaf drop is not a salt excretion mechanism, but is simply the point in time at which the leaf ceases to accumulate salt. Using a simple model, the contribution to salt accumulation of slowly accumulated Na+ by mature leaves has been calculated. For B. cylindrica, the most extensively studied species, 60% of the salt in the leaf is accumulated slowly in the mature phase, thus more than during the initial phase of rapid expansion growth. The limited data suggest that gland-bearing species show smaller changes in mature leaf Na+ content than do gland-less species.",0.026240254,0.00406774,0.014531085,0.0131683,0.022168279,0.011335302,0.005225098,0.015233528,0.026521493,0.007007995,0.7372872,0.015845636,0.027300924,0.003416643,0.008069125,0.012523213,0.003604307,0.006541192,0.023999445,0.012840934,0.012523833,0.009505806,0.012018092,0.012493799,0.008312449,0.016868431,0.008247295,0.01371888,0.003684279,['basidiomycetes'],[0.014492753623188002],[1.0]

Research on the grasping mechanism and behaviour of locusts on sloping substrates plays an important role in elucidating the mechanics of hexapod locomotion. Data on the maximum angles of slope at which locusts can grasp stably (critical angles of detachment) were obtained from high-speed video recordings at 215 fps. The grasping forces were collected by using two sensors, in situations where all left legs were standing on one and the right legs on the other sensor plate. These data were used to illustrate the grasping ability of locusts on slopes with varying levels of roughness. The grasping morphologies of locusts' bodies and tarsi were observed, and the surface roughness as well as diameters of their claw tips was measured under a microscope to account for the grasping mechanism of these insects on the sloping substrate. The results showed that the claw tips and part of the pads were in contact with the inverted substrate when the mean particle diameter was in the range of 15.3-40.5 µm. The interaction between pads and substrates may improve the stability of contact, and claw tips may play a key role in keeping the attachment reliable. A model was developed to explain the significant effects of the relative size of claw tips and mean particle diameter on grasping ability as well as the observed increase in lateral force (2.09-4.05 times greater than the normal force during detachment) with increasing slope angle, which indicates that the lateral force may be extremely important in keeping the contact reliable.

Their unique extracellular electron transfer (EET) capabilities extend to reduction of anodes (electrodes maintained at sufficiently positive potentials) on which they form persistent, electric current generating biofilms. One hypothesis describing the mechanism of EET by Geobacter and Shewanella spp. involves superexchange in which electrons are conducted by a succession of electron transfer reactions among redox proteins associated with the outer cell membranes, aligned along pilus-like filaments (e.g.pili), and/or throughout the extracellular matrix. Here we present theory, previously developed to describe superexchange within abiotic redox polymers, to describe superexchange within DMRB biofilms grown on anodes. We show that this theory appears to apply to recent ex situ measurements of electrical conductivity by individual pilus-like filaments of S. oneidensis MR-1 and G. sulfurreducensDL1, referred to as microbial nanowires. Microbial nanowires have received much recent attention because they are thought by some to impart electrical conductivity to DMRB biofilms and because of the prospect of microbe-produced conductive nanomaterials. We also show that this theory appears to apply to preliminary in situ demonstration of electrical conductivity of an anode-grown G. sulfurreducensDL1 biofilm.

There is little direct evidence, however, that novel chemical traits arising from gene duplication reduce herbivory. Higher plants use threonine deaminase (TD) to catalyze the dehydration of threonine (Thr) to α-ketobutyrate and ammonia as the committed step in the biosynthesis of isoleucine (Ile). Cultivated tomato and related Solanum species contain a duplicated TD paralog (TD2) that is coexpressed with a suite of genes involved in herbivore resistance. Analysis of TD2-deficient tomato lines showed that TD2 has a defensive function related to Thr catabolism in the gut of lepidopteran herbivores. During herbivory, the regulatory domain of TD2 is removed by proteolysis to generate a truncated protein (pTD2) that efficiently degrades Thr without being inhibited by Ile. We show that this proteolytic activation step occurs in the gut of lepidopteran but not coleopteran herbivores, and is catalyzed by a chymotrypsin-like protease of insect origin. Analysis of purified recombinant enzymes showed that TD2 is remarkably more resistant to proteolysis and high temperature than the ancestral TD1 isoform. The crystal structure of pTD2 provided evidence that electrostatic interactions constitute a stabilizing feature associated with adaptation of TD2 to the extreme environment of the lepidopteran gut. These findings demonstrate a role for gene duplication in the evolution of a plant defense that targets and co-opts herbivore digestive physiology.",0.009833751,0.009349992,0.011544397,0.013706833,0.007178363,0.007503462,0.006924396,0.015912812,0.011158179,0.009825276,0.021078292,0.007970349,0.8914196,0.009154831,0.011755879,0.006308665,0.010009723,0.009953114,0.008133717,0.012557869,0.009471728,0.009544801,0.011901893,0.008666189,0.011396953,0.014800711,0.008807408,0.010597863,0.01021967,['mammals'],[0.06],[1.0]

The cuticle is a complex structure of soluble lipids, lipid polymers and polysaccharides. In addition to its functions to reduce water loss and provide a protective barrier, its mechanical properties may be significant to plant growth and development. We investigated the cuticle of Cirsium horridulum Michx. because of its involvement in the thigmonastic contraction of staminal filaments. The staminal filaments and portions of the style are surrounded by a highly elastic cuticle in contrast to the rigid cuticle of the corolla and leaves. Our aim was to determine if the biochemical composition affected the elasticity of the cuticle. We discovered that the ratio of carbohydrates to lipids is 1:7 in floral parts but 2:1 in leaf cuticle. Esterified cutin components represented about 80% of the cuticle and di-hydroxyhexadecanoic acids were the major monomers of cutin, regardless of origin. The cutin of elastic tissues is characterized by a higher content of tri-hydroxy monomers than the cutin of rigid tissues. The data suggest that hydroxyl groups enhance the hydrophilic character of the cuticle and contribute to cuticular elasticity.",0.010438454,0.019991795,0.02796368,0.01198357,0.036341757,0.011674487,0.030141277,0.017076679,0.07887969,0.029112516,0.03374199,0.027464628,0.015340106,0.011252123,0.036495477,0.8751651,0.01034035,0.023053164,0.02416999,0.030876203,0.021601735,0.007227695,0.34686336,0.016352825,0.022289459,0.035024703,0.03317947,0.8061426,0.038184237,"['ormia', 'ormia ochracea']","[0.017241379310344, 0.017241379310344]","[1.0, 1.0]"

We have analyzed the subtle physical mechanism responsible for drop transport and demonstrated experimentally that the beak geometry and the dynamics of tweezering may be tuned to optimize transport efficiency.

They often escape predators, parasitoids and grazing mammalian herbivores by dropping off the plant [1,2], avoiding immediate danger but exposing themselves to ground predators, starvation and desiccation [3]. We show here that dropping pea aphids land on their legs, regardless of their initial orientation on the plant (like a defenestrated cat), by rotating their body during the fall. This righting ability is intriguing, as wingless aphids have no specialized structures for maneuvering in mid-air. Instead, they assume a stereotypic posture which is aerodynamically stable only when the aphids fall right-side up. Consequently, the body passively rotates to the stable upright orientation, improving the chance of clinging to leaves encountered on the way down and lowering the danger of reaching the ground.",0.008285515,0.022913972,0.006600922,0.005490571,0.05455077,0.015044996,0.008567909,0.006338705,0.006565157,0.010279493,0.007762434,0.004503399,0.015911663,0.00742296,0.019625206,0.007136928,0.013775313,0.010758188,0.009015792,0.009908162,0.008274438,0.010728147,0.011647954,0.008850525,0.049425337,0.011971612,0.81530994,0.02727262,0.017014515,"['machaerium', 'plants', 'mimosa pudica']","[0.013698630136986, 0.034246575342465, 0.006849315068493]","[0.4, 1.0, 0.2]"

The structural and functional part of the model, which hereafter is referred to as ""the cubic rod-packing model"", postulates that stratum corneum keratin intermediate filaments are arranged according to a cubic-like rod-packing symmetry with or without the presence of an intracellular lipid membrane with cubic-like symmetry enveloping each individual filament.

These living cells, along with plant spores and pollen grains, may act as nuclei for condensation of water in clouds. Basidiospores released by mushrooms form a significant proportion of these aerosols, particularly above tropical forests. Mushroom spores are discharged from gills by the rapid displacement of a droplet of fluid on the cell surface. This droplet is formed by the condensation of water on the spore surface stimulated by the secretion of mannitol and other hygroscopic sugars. This fluid is carried with the spore during discharge, but evaporates once the spore is airborne. Using environmental electron microscopy, we have demonstrated that droplets reform on spores in humid air. The kinetics of this process suggest that basidiospores are especially effective as nuclei for the formation of large water drops in clouds. Through this mechanism, mushroom spores may promote rainfall in ecosystems that support large populations of ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic basidiomycetes.

Empirical support for Allen’s rule is mainly derived from occasional reports of geographical clines in extremity size of individual species. Interspecific evidence is restricted to two studies of leg proportions in seabirds and shorebirds. We used phylogenetic comparative analyses of 214 bird species to examine whether bird bills, significant sites of heat exchange, conform to Allen’s rule. The species comprised eight diverse taxonomic groups—toucans, African barbets, Australian parrots, estrildid finches, Canadian galliforms, penguins, gulls, and terns. Across all species, there were strongly significant relationships between bill length and both latitude and environmental temperature, with species in colder climates having significantly shorter bills. Patterns supporting Allen’s rule in relation to latitudinal or altitudinal distribution held within all groups except the finches. Evidence for a direct association with temperature was found within four groups (parrots, galliforms, penguins, and gulls). Support for Allen’s rule in leg elements was weaker, suggesting that bird bills may be more susceptible to thermoregulatory constraints generally.

Thus, the creation of nanoscale acoustic microphones with directional sensitivity is very difficult. The fly Ormia ochracea possesses an unusual ‘ear’ that largely overcomes these physical constraints; attempts to exploit principles derived from O. ochracea for improved hearing aids are now in progress. Here we report that O. ochracea can behaviourally localize a salient sound source with a precision equal to that of humans. Despite its small size and minuscule interaural cues, the fly localizes sound sources to within 2° azimuth. As the fly's eardrums are less than 0.5 mm apart, localization cues are around 50 ns. Directional information is represented in the auditory system by the relative timing of receptor responses in the two ears. Low-jitter, phasic receptor responses are pooled to achieve hyperacute timecoding. These results demonstrate that nanoscale/microscale directional microphones patterned after O. ochracea have the potential for highly accurate directional sensitivity, independent of their size.

Experiments show that leaflets with acuminate tips have an improved water-shedding ability. A STUDY WAS CONDUCTED to test the effects of leaf shape and leaf movement on shedding of rain water by juvenile plants of Machaerium aorboreum (Jacq.) Vogel (Leguminosae), a liana of Panamanian lowland forests. The leaflets have acuminate tips (""driptips""), and exhibit both thigmonasty (movement in response to tacile stimuli) and nyctinasty (diurnal movement patterns). Thigmonasty also occurs in Mimosa pudica L. (Leguminosae), the ""sensitive plant"" (Roblin 1976), and many other tropical legumes The leaflets of Mimosa fold within a few seconds following gentle stimuli. Raindrops initiate thigmonastic responses in other tropical plants (von Denffer et al. 1976). The functional significance of this response has not been determined. Nyctinastic leaves may protect meristematic tissue from frost damage in some high-elevation plants (Smith 1974), but their adaptive significance in low-elevation tropical plants is undear (Darwin 1881, Satter and Galston 1971, Schwintzer 1971). Jungner (1891) was one of the first to regard drip-tips as an adaptation for rapid draining of the leaf surface. He observed that leaves with drip-tips dried more quickly, and were less overgrown with epiphyllae, than leaves without drip-tips. He believed that by facilitating water runoff, drip-tips kept the leaf surface relatively clear of spores of epiphyllae, and soluble substances which might encourage epiphyllae growth. Stahl (1898) showed that by removing the drip-tips he could increase the time required for a leaf to dry, but he doubted there was any correlation between drip-tips and the presence or absence of epiphyllae. He instead proposed that driptips functioned to prevent a lingering surface film of water, which would lower the surface temperature of the leaf, which in turn would slow the rate of transpiration by the plant. A low rate of transpiralPresent address: Department of Zoology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa 52242, U.S.A. tion, he reasoned, would slow the uptake of mineral salts by the roots, which would be disadvantageous to the plant. Shreve (1914), working in the understory in the montane forest of Jamaica, was unable to detect any difference in the rate of drying in leaves with driptips removed versus those with drip-tips intact. Richards (1966) maintains that Shreve worked with plants with atypical, abbreviated drip-tips, and that his results do not therefore disprove the hypothesis that drip-tips have a drying function. According to Richards and to Edmisten (1970), the controversy about the ecological significance of drip-tips remains unsolved.",0.56572604,0.004139997,0.007827527,0.004097718,0.004327654,0.006295132,0.004704658,0.002850042,0.007701057,0.006713627,0.007029973,0.00866857,0.006002976,0.005175947,0.00453746,0.026571076,0.002596436,0.007712485,0.013381071,0.020637905,0.004825152,0.003323537,0.023693182,0.003353354,0.004263479,0.005251707,0.004154592,0.017060688,0.006548273,['plants'],[0.015625],[1.0]

Compared with the majority of terrestrial insects, bees have a high water turnover. This is due to their nectar diet and, in larger species, substantial metabolic water production during flight, counteracted by high evaporative and excretory losses. Water fluxes at the colony level can also be very high. When incoming nectar is dilute, honeybees need to remove large volumes of water by evaporation. On the other hand, water is not stored in the nest and must be collected for evaporative cooling and for feeding the brood. Water regulation has many similarities at individual and colony levels. In particular, manipulation of nectar or water on the tongue is extensively used by bees to increase evaporation for either food-concentrating or cooling purposes.",0.008432639,0.01701504,0.006524607,0.005029537,0.008972203,0.012728316,0.00833103,0.006344138,0.008774894,0.006123214,0.010925815,0.006322484,0.00693099,0.005485595,0.004102467,0.016347174,0.006378458,0.007031518,0.007061238,0.00757171,0.009413341,0.005949067,0.9416005,0.003769222,0.008097927,0.007197797,0.006061149,0.00790388,0.009751747,['sponges'],[0.063291139240506],[1.0]

Spider silk is therefore a model polymer for development of high performance biomimetic fibers. There are over 41.000 described species of spiders, most spinning multiple types of silk. Thus we have available some 200.000+ unique silks that may cover an amazing breadth of material properties. To date, however, silks from only a few tens of species have been characterized, most chosen haphazardly as model organisms (Nephila) or simply from researchers' backyards. Are we limited to ‘blindly fishing’ in efforts to discover extraordinary silks? Or, could scientists use ecology to predict which species are likely to spin silks exhibiting exceptional performance properties? Methodology We examined the biomechanical properties of silk produced by the remarkable Malagasy ‘Darwin's bark spider’ (Caerostris darwini), which we predicted would produce exceptional silk based upon its amazing web. The spider constructs its giant orb web (up to 2.8 m2) suspended above streams, rivers, and lakes. It attaches the web to substrates on each riverbank by anchor threads as long as 25 meters. Dragline silk from both Caerostris webs and forcibly pulled silk, exhibits an extraordinary combination of high tensile strength and elasticity previously unknown for spider silk. The toughness of forcibly silked fibers averages 350 MJ/m3, with some samples reaching 520 MJ/m3. Thus, C. darwini silk is more than twice tougher than any previously described silk, and over 10 times better than Kevlar®. Caerostris capture spiral silk is similarly exceptionally tough. Conclusions Caerostris darwini produces the toughest known biomaterial. We hypothesize that this extraordinary toughness coevolved with the unusual ecology and web architecture of these spiders, decreasing the likelihood of bridgelines breaking and collapsing the web into the river. This hypothesis predicts that rapid change in material properties of silk co-occurred with ecological shifts within the genus, and can thus be tested by combining material science, behavioral observations, and phylogenetics. Our findings highlight the potential benefits of natural history–informed bioprospecting to discover silks, as well as other materials, with novel and exceptional properties to serve as models in biomimicry.",0.010445032,0.010023394,0.01999155,0.009801623,0.8532297,0.012194977,0.030510738,0.02731888,0.012001599,0.018915532,0.013796493,0.007757357,0.013310667,0.011988974,0.01187932,0.012616939,0.020379538,0.014900316,0.012756245,0.009074707,0.021839367,0.00714743,0.015191973,0.017661704,0.8253214,0.016518189,0.07085638,0.017027479,0.009666783,"['pseudotsuga menziesii', 'douglas-fir', 'rhizopogon vesiculosus', 'rhizopogon vinicolor']","[0.0, 0.014084507042253001, 0.028169014084507, 0.014084507042253001]","[0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5]"

Iridescent colours are found in a broad diversity of animal taxa ranging from diminutive marine copepods to terrestrial insects and birds.

We then highlight unique properties of iridescent signals and review the proposed functions of iridescent coloration, focusing, in particular, on the ways in which iridescent colours allow animals to communicate with conspecifics and avoid predators.

Those with the longest ranges are powered by hydrostatic pressure and include “squirt guns” that are most common in the Ascomycota and Zygomycota. In these fungi, fluid-filled stalks that support single spores or spore-filled sporangia, or cells called asci that contain multiple spores, are pressurized by osmosis. Because spores are discharged at such high speeds, most of the information on launch processes from previous studies has been inferred from mathematical models and is subject to a number of errors. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we have used ultra-high-speed video cameras running at maximum frame rates of 250,000 fps to analyze the entire launch process in four species of fungi that grow on the dung of herbivores. For the first time we have direct measurements of launch speeds and empirical estimates of acceleration in these fungi. Launch speeds ranged from 2 to 25 m s−1 and corresponding accelerations of 20,000 to 180,000 g propelled spores over distances of up to 2.5 meters. In addition, quantitative spectroscopic methods were used to identify the organic and inorganic osmolytes responsible for generating the turgor pressures that drive spore discharge. Conclusions/Significance The new video data allowed us to test different models for the effect of viscous drag and identify errors in the previous approaches to modeling spore motion. The spectroscopic data show that high speed spore discharge mechanisms in fungi are powered by the same levels of turgor pressure that are characteristic of fungal hyphae and do not require any special mechanisms of osmolyte accumulation.",0.16744399,0.008328754,0.01553181,0.008598141,0.013499456,0.006534545,0.005231357,0.010043139,0.009222206,0.025191888,0.018667296,0.015103297,0.015651125,0.018348532,0.012132834,0.011677183,0.010095079,0.017167687,0.7888999,0.008519907,0.0230951,0.012189453,0.015417377,0.004595157,0.007423829,0.012289252,0.007781272,0.024135003,0.006437505,['plants'],[0.04],[1.0]

Transporters that are members of the Ca2+/cation antiporter (CaCA) superfamily are involved in the transport of Ca2+ and/or other cations using the counter exchange of another ion such as H+ or Na+. The CaCA superfamily has been previously divided into five transporter families: the YRBG, Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX), Na+/Ca2+, K+ exchanger (NCKX), H+/cation exchanger (CAX), and cation/Ca2+ exchanger (CCX) families, which include the well-characterized NCX and CAX transporters. To examine the evolution of CaCA transporters within higher plants and the green plant lineage, CaCA genes were identified from the genomes of sequenced flowering plants, a bryophyte, lycophyte, and freshwater and marine algae, and compared with those from non-plant species. We found evidence of the expansion and increased diversity of flowering plant genes within the CAX and CCX families. Genes related to the NCX family are present in land plant though they encode distinct MHX homologs which probably have an altered transport function. In contrast, the NCX and NCKX genes which are absent in land plants have been retained in many species of algae, especially the marine algae, indicating that these organisms may share “animal-like” characteristics of Ca2+ homeostasis and signaling. A group of genes encoding novel CAX-like proteins containing an EF-hand domain were identified from plants and selected algae but appeared to be lacking in any other species. Lack of functional data for most of the CaCA proteins make it impossible to reliably predict substrate specificity and function for many of the groups or individual proteins. The abundance and diversity of CaCA genes throughout all branches of life indicates the importance of this class of cation transporter, and that many transporters with novel functions are waiting to be discovered.",0.017496618,0.005856833,0.010155891,0.019855842,0.015906228,0.012434297,0.00812673,0.014915792,0.012926136,0.00786835,0.87964714,0.018426146,0.03555516,0.005482292,0.011989607,0.021123081,0.004933384,0.008955907,0.013233011,0.015050382,0.01984751,0.009716012,0.03458824,0.016472222,0.011208748,0.020836065,0.008163014,0.01004009,0.006603471,"['snakes', 'python', 'python molurus', 'python sebae']","[0.015151515151515001, 0.030303030303030002, 0.015151515151515001, 0.015151515151515001]","[0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5]"

It creates a dome-shaped web between aquatic plants and fills the diving bell with air carried from the surface. The bell can take up dissolved O2 from the water, acting as a ‘physical gill’. By measuring bell volume and O2 partial pressure (PO2) with tiny O2-sensitive optodes, this study showed that the spiders produce physical gills capable of satisfying at least their resting requirements for O2 under the most extreme conditions of warm stagnant water. Larger spiders produced larger bells of higher O2 conductance (GO2). GO2 depended on surface area only; effective boundary layer thickness was constant. Bells, with and without spiders, were used as respirometers by measuring GO2 and the rate of change in PO2. Metabolic rates were also measured with flow-through respirometry. The water–air PO2 difference was generally less than 10 kPa, and spiders voluntarily tolerated low internal PO2 approximately 1–4 kPa before renewal with air from the surface. The low PO2 in the bell enhanced N2 loss from the bell, but spiders could remain inside for more than a day without renewal. Spiders appeared to enlarge the bells in response to higher O2 demands and lower aquatic PO2.",0.039012685,0.004980181,0.029775312,0.004282607,0.03021665,0.16427067,0.010617049,0.005826809,0.30498907,0.004674902,0.009759818,0.004300719,0.005555257,0.002786541,0.004017001,0.013578669,0.010182972,0.007300234,0.008050145,0.021886507,0.012347313,0.003635911,0.087645516,0.004692552,0.00375692,0.005253992,0.002993316,0.004586426,0.004852964,"['chickens', 'bird', 'chicken', 'robin', 'european robin', 'birds']","[0.09090909090909001, 0.018181818181818, 0.09090909090909001, 0.018181818181818, 0.0, 0.018181818181818]","[1.0, 0.199999999999999, 1.0, 0.199999999999999, 0.0, 0.199999999999999]"

In his engineering, use of materials and energy, man lets design takes second place, whereas nature treats materials as expensive and designs with apparent care and attention to detail. This results in durable materials and cheap structures that are easy to recycle under ambient conditions. Examples illustrating this principle, which are given here, are drawn from both animals and plants with comments on the underlying mechanisms such as self-assembly of liquid crystal systems, use of composite structures, and control of fracture properties. The natural world, of which we are a significant part, has many examples of survival with minimum use of energy. These examples range from the production and use of materials to the organization of entire populations. But not all organisms exist in a half-lit, miserly half-life. Their (that is to say, our) driving purpose in life is to reproduce, and no organism (that is, me or you) would be here unless our parents had a strong urge to reproduce, something which we, mostly, inherit. So any way that we can have the largest number of surviving offspring will be favored. In doing this we are in competition with nearly all the other organisms in the vicinity. The ones with which we are overtly friendly are our immediate genetic (or to a lesser extent, social) relatives, and much has been made of the concept that it is our genes, rather than ourselves, that crave dominance.",0.009110606,0.017346095,0.01446084,0.008014704,0.9232421,0.014737722,0.037423585,0.016796716,0.012169334,0.026502209,0.01066566,0.006993288,0.01434673,0.011445251,0.04537228,0.011609759,0.013052835,0.015101992,0.011449233,0.009215311,0.015019205,0.018493783,0.011002544,0.01692229,0.105812386,0.016712083,0.8955692,0.027487053,0.013425362,[],[],[]

As sessile filter feeders in marine or freshwater habitats, they often live in close association with phototrophic microorganisms. Active photosynthesis by the associated microorganisms has been believed to be restricted to the outer tissue portion of the sponge hosts. However, phototrophic microorganisms have also been detected in deeper tissue regions. In many cases they are found around spicules, siliceous skelettal elements of demosponges and hexactinellids. The finding of phototrophic organisms seemingly assembled around spicules led to the hypothesis of a siliceous light transmission system in sponges. The principle ability to conduct light was already shown for sponge derived, explanted spicules. However it was not shown until now, that in deed sponges have a light transmission system, and can harbour photosynthetically active microorganisms in deeper tissue regions. 
 
Here we show for the first time, that, as hypothesized 13 year ago, sponge spicules in living specimens transmit light into deeper tissue regions. Our results demonstrate that in opposite to the actual opinion, photosynthetically active microorganisms can also live in deeper tissue regions, and not only directly beneath the surface, when a light transmission system (spicules) is present. 
 
Our results show the possibility of massive or globular sponges being supplied with photosynthetic products or pathways throughout their whole body, implying not only a more important role of these endobioses. Our findings also elucidate the in-situ function of a recently more and more interesting biomaterial, which is unique not only for its mechanical, electrical and optical properties.

Evidence collected from schooling animals suggests that the process is somewhat democratic, with nearest neighbors and the majority shaping overall collective behavior. In animals with hierarchical social structures such as primates or wolves, however, such democracy may be complicated by dominance. Strandburg-Peshkin et al. monitored all the individuals within a baboon troop continuously over the course of their daily activities. Even within this highly socially structured species, movement decisions emerged via a shared process. Thus, democracy may be an inherent trait of collective behavior. Science, this issue p. 1358 Democracy guides group decisions in baboons, even in the presence of strong social hierarchies. Conflicts of interest about where to go and what to do are a primary challenge of group living. However, it remains unclear how consensus is achieved in stable groups with stratified social relationships. Tracking wild baboons with a high-resolution global positioning system and analyzing their movements relative to one another reveals that a process of shared decision-making governs baboon movement. Rather than preferentially following dominant individuals, baboons are more likely to follow when multiple initiators agree. When conflicts arise over the direction of movement, baboons choose one direction over the other when the angle between them is large, but they compromise if it is not. These results are consistent with models of collective motion, suggesting that democratic collective action emerging from simple rules is widespread, even in complex, socially stratified societies.",0.015868168,0.007436809,0.018729689,0.005186435,0.005760318,0.12046409,0.004743444,0.005409252,0.012611373,0.010715578,0.004011615,0.003083994,0.003992563,0.005996008,0.002958393,0.004002087,0.04006196,0.005167724,0.003592436,0.012477743,0.002836148,0.02929177,0.010683774,0.015221629,0.00341597,0.009081505,0.006144492,0.002396722,0.09709065,[],[],[]

Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) secreted by algae and bacteria give structure to periphyton, and differences in EPS chemistry affect the functional roles of these polymers. The Florida Everglades provide a unique opportunity to study compositional differences of EPS from distinctive algal assemblages that characterize areas of differing water chemistry. Water conservation area (WCA)‐1 is a soft‐water impoundment; periphyton was loosely associated with Utricularia stems and amorphous in structure, with a diverse desmid and diatom assemblage, and varying cyanobacterial abundance. Extracellular polymers were abundant and were loosely cell‐associated sheaths and slime layers in addition to tightly cell‐associated capsules. The EPS were complex heteropolysaccharides with significant saccharide residues of glucose, xylose, arabinose, and fucose. Carboxylic acids were also prominent, while ester sulfates and proteins were small components. Structured, cohesive cyanobacteria‐dominated periphyton was observed in WCA‐2A, a minerotrophic impoundment, and filaments were heavily encrusted with calcium carbonate and detrital matter. EPS were primarily cell‐associated sheaths, and polymer residues were dominated by glucose, xylose, fucose, and galactose, with uronic acids also a significant component of the polymers.

In a BES, bacteria interact with electrodes using electrons, which are either removed or supplied through an electrical circuit. The most-described type of BES is microbial fuel cells (MFCs), in which useful power is generated from electron donors as, for example, present in wastewater. This form of charge transport, known as extracellular electron transfer, was previously extensively described with respect to metals such as iron and manganese. The importance of these interactions in global biogeochemical cycles is essentially undisputed. A wide variety of bacteria can participate in extracellular electron transfer, and this phenomenon is far more widespread than previously thought. The use of BESs in diverse research projects is helping elucidate the mechanism by which bacteria shuttle electrons externally. New forms of interactions between bacteria have been discovered demonstrating how multiple populations within microbial communities can co-operate to achieve energy generation. New environmental processes that were difficult to observe or study previously can now be simulated and improved via BESs. Whereas pure culture studies make up the majority of the studies performed thus far, even greater contributions of BESs are expected to occur in natural environments and with mixed microbial communities. Owing to their versatility, unmatched level of control and capacity to sustain novel processes, BESs might well serve as the foundation of a new environmental biotechnology.

Exposing chickens to an oscillating field of 1.566 MHz led to disorientation, identifying an underlying radical pair mechanism. Local anesthesia of the upper beak, where iron-rich structures have been described as potential magnetoreceptors, did not affect the performance, suggesting that these receptors are not involved in compass orientation. These findings show obvious parallels to the magnetic compass described for European robins, indicating that chickens and small passerines use the same type of magnetic compass mechanism. This suggests that the avian magnetic compass may have evolved in the common ancestor of all present-day birds to facilitate orientation within the home range.",0.019992761,0.25215912,0.02502164,0.008968215,0.006714413,0.008201908,0.007055011,0.006458118,0.006522979,0.006950683,0.004191688,0.004493657,0.004772021,0.006454344,0.00186217,0.003873749,0.010706478,0.007373469,0.005926775,0.006964481,0.004110902,0.0855175,0.049102128,0.005321927,0.005796692,0.007346842,0.0050638,0.003426143,0.009690051,"['alligator', 'american alligator', 'alligators']","[0.11764705882352901, 0.0, 0.11764705882352901]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0]"

Previous studies have shown that chemical composition changes as the antler is grown, implying constraints in mineral availability and the physiological effort made to grow it. This study aimed at examining antler mechanical properties to assess whether they reflect physiological effort and whether they are associated with precise mineral bone composition rather than just ash content, which is usually the main factor affecting mechanical properties. We examined Young's modulus of elasticity (E), strength, and work to maximum load, as well as bone mineral composition, along the antler shaft. Then we compared trends between antlers from two populations: captive, well-fed, health-managed deer (n=15), and free-ranging deer with lower food quality and no health treatment (n=10). Greater E, strength and work were found for better fed and health managed deer. In addition, antler chemical composition of both populations differed in Na, Mg, K, Fe and Si, and marginally in Zn, but not in ash or Ca content. Significant and clear divergent trends in mechanical properties supporting greater physiological exhaustion in free-ranging deer were found for all mechanical variables. Detailed models showed that, in addition to ash content, independent factors extracted from principal component analyses on composition affected E and strength, but not work to maximum load. The results suggest that there is an association between bone chemical composition and mechanical properties independently of ash content.",0.01100336,0.009824395,0.011672209,0.014926017,0.029917143,0.007856246,0.014907393,0.013315102,0.004133948,0.015134645,0.009822697,0.012629657,0.020298572,0.01873652,0.00731175,0.010414043,0.012032929,0.01139445,0.009374967,0.009607102,0.014669809,0.007922396,0.017951913,0.019278048,0.7900136,0.013442874,0.029426372,0.015913865,0.010800359,"['dermacentor variabilis', 'ticks', 'acari', 'ixodidae', 'amblyomma americanum', 'ixodes scapularis', 'amblyomma hebraeum']","[0.012048192771084001, 0.012048192771084001, 0.012048192771084001, 0.036144578313253004, 0.012048192771084001, 0.0, 0.012048192771084001]","[0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304, 1.0, 0.33333333333333304, 0.0, 0.33333333333333304]"

The introduction of oil or oil constituents into seawater leads to successive blooms of a relatively limited number of indigenous marine bacterial genera--Alcanivorax, Marinobacter, Thallassolituus, Cycloclasticus, Oleispira and a few others (the OHCB)--which are present at low or undetectable levels before the polluting event. The types of OHCB that bloom depend on the latitude/temperature, salinity, redox and other prevailing physical-chemical factors. These blooms result in the rapid degradation of many oil constituents, a process that can be accelerated further by supplementation with limiting nutrients. Genome sequencing and functional genomic analysis of Alcanivorax borkumensis, the paradigm of OHCB, has provided significant insights into the genomic basis of the efficiency and versatility of its hydrocarbon utilization, the metabolic routes underlying its special hydrocarbon diet, and its ecological success.

However, deciphering the mechanistic sources of these effects has been problematic due to a lack of tools to resolve molecular structures on mineral surfaces during growth. Here we report atomic force microscopy investigations using a system designed to maximize resolution while minimizing contact force. By imaging the growth of calcium-oxalate monohydrate under the influence of aspartic-rich peptides at single-molecule resolution, we reveal how the unique interactions of polypeptides with mineral surfaces lead to acceleration, inhibition, and switching of growth between two distinct states. Interaction with the positively charged face of calcium-oxalate monohydrate leads to formation of a peptide film, but the slow adsorption kinetics and gradual relaxation to a well-bound state result in time-dependent effects. These include a positive feedback between peptide adsorption and step inhibition described by a mathematical catastrophe that results in growth hysteresis, characterized by rapid switching from fast to near-zero growth rates for very small reductions in supersaturation. Interactions with the negatively charged face result in formation of peptide clusters that impede step advancement. The result is a competition between accelerated solute attachment and inhibition due to blocking of the steps by the clusters.

Locally the bile pigment is combined with the strongly blue-absorbing carotenoid lutein, resulting in green wing patches and thus improving camouflage. In the dorsal forewings, the colored patches lack the usual wing scales, but instead have bristles. We have found that on the ventral side most of these patches have very transparent scales that enhance, by reflection, the wing coloration when illuminated from the dorsal side.

For example, echolocating bats are known to control many aspects of their sonar signal design. However, their sensory data-acquisition strategies are still not fully understood. Yovel et al. (p. 701) found that Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) did not aim their sonar beams directly on target in a standard localization task. Instead, the bats pointed the main lobe of their sonar beam off-axis. Bats approaching the target emitted sounds to the left and right of its localization, in an alternating manner, so that the maximum slope of the change in intensity of the sonar beam was often positioned close to the target. This echolocation strategy is ideal for target localization but occurs at the cost of target detection. Echolocating Egyptian fruit bats do not center their sonar clicks on a target, thereby maximizing localization of the target. Is centering a stimulus in the field of view an optimal strategy to localize and track it? We demonstrated, through experimental and computational studies, that the answer is no. We trained echolocating Egyptian fruit bats to localize a target in complete darkness, and we measured the directional aim of their sonar clicks. The bats did not center the sonar beam on the target, but instead pointed it off axis, accurately directing the maximum slope (“edge”) of the beam onto the target. Information-theoretic calculations showed that using the maximum slope is optimal for localizing the target, at the cost of detection. We propose that the tradeoff between detection (optimized at stimulus peak) and localization (optimized at maximum slope) is fundamental to spatial localization and tracking accomplished through hearing, olfaction, and vision.",0.025999503,0.021092815,0.044144362,0.064458065,0.022777006,0.041803952,0.04159105,0.01243972,0.03394472,0.036213633,0.012570309,0.02746403,0.036095165,0.04070473,0.013503071,0.013687791,0.84859675,0.029996201,0.030804614,0.033312883,0.035392378,0.8167165,0.029871939,0.033071008,0.015530723,0.026159966,0.011355401,0.011067869,0.05018984,"['ape', 'pan', 'gorilla', 'pongo', 'great apes', 'apes']","[0.054054054054054, 0.027027027027027, 0.027027027027027, 0.027027027027027, 0.0, 0.027027027027027]","[1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5]"

While interactions between ants, host plants, and herbivores have been intensively studied, we know little about how plant-plant interactions influence the dynamics of these mutualisms, despite strong evidence that plants compete for resources, that hosting ants can be costly, and that host-plant provisioning to ants can therefore be constrained by resource availability. We used field experiments in a semiarid Kenyan savanna to examine interactions between the ant-plant Acacia drepanolobium, neighboring grasses, and two species of symbiotic acacia-ants with divergent behaviors: Crematogaster mimosae, an aggressive symbiont that imposes high costs to host trees via consumption of extrafloral nectar, and Tetraponera penzigi, a less-protective symbiont that imposes lower costs because it does not consume nectar. We hypothesized that by competing with acacias for resources, neighboring grasses (1) reduce hosts' ability to support costly C. mimosae, while having little or no effect on the ability of hosts to support low-cost T. penzigi, and (2) reduce sapling growth rates irrespective of ant occupant. We factorially manipulated the presence/absence of grasses and the identity of ant occupants on saplings and evaluated effects on colony survivorship and sapling growth rates over 40 weeks. Contrary to prediction, the high-cost/high-reward nectar-dependent mutualist C. mimosae had higher colony-survival rates on saplings with grass neighbors present. Grasses appear to have indirectly facilitated the survival of C. mimosae by reducing water stress on host plants; soils under saplings shaded by grasses had higher moisture content, and these saplings produced more active nectaries than grass-removal saplings. Consistent with prediction, survival of low-cost/low-reward T. penzigi did not differ significantly between grass-removal treatments. Saplings occupied by low-cost/low-reward T. penzigi grew 100% more on average than saplings occupied by high-cost/high-reward C. mimosae, demonstrating that mutualist-partner identity strongly and differentially influences demographic rates of young plants. In contrast, contrary to prediction, grass neighbors had no significant net impact on sapling growth rates. Our results suggest that neighboring plants can exert strong and counterintuitive effects on ant-plant protection symbioses, highlighting the need to integrate plant-plant interactions into our understanding of these mutualisms.",0.114551775,0.002088144,0.005720805,0.012079917,0.004780916,0.003727557,0.00269322,0.002722177,0.002471466,0.006301623,0.009878325,0.01151344,0.003997598,0.038670164,0.003774829,0.010928134,0.003881157,0.004202687,0.024555469,0.003679096,0.003108329,0.008184336,0.006222198,0.011860796,0.00466642,0.009310286,0.002850051,0.004884356,0.003926164,"['apis', 'bee', 'honey bees', 'honey bee', 'apis mellifera', 'bees']","[0.011627906976744, 0.034883720930232, 0.011627906976744, 0.034883720930232, 0.011627906976744, 0.011627906976744]","[0.33333333333333304, 1.0, 0.33333333333333304, 1.0, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304]"

Among these features are the appearance of low density pollen grains, female ovulate organs that direct air currents carrying pollen toward stigmas or micropyles, and population structures with a high density of con-specifics. This paper reviews the aerodynamic theory, and the experimental and field data that are relevant to an understanding of the adaptive significance of these and other features of anemophily. Emphasis is placed on the mathematical description of the behavior of airflow patterns around ovulate organs.

Salt stress has become a major threat to plant growth and productivity. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonize plant root systems and modulate plant growth in various ways.


SCOPE
This review addresses the significance of arbuscular mycorrhiza in alleviation of salt stress and their beneficial effects on plant growth and productivity. It also focuses on recent progress in unravelling biochemical, physiological and molecular mechanisms in mycorrhizal plants to alleviate salt stress.


CONCLUSIONS
The role of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in alleviating salt stress is well documented. This paper reviews the mechanisms arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi employ to enhance the salt tolerance of host plants such as enhanced nutrient acquisition (P, N, Mg and Ca), maintenance of the K(+) : Na(+) ratio, biochemical changes (accumulation of proline, betaines, polyamines, carbohydrates and antioxidants), physiological changes (photosynthetic efficiency, relative permeability, water status, abscissic acid accumulation, nodulation and nitrogen fixation), molecular changes (the expression of genes: PIP, Na(+)/H(+) antiporters, Lsnced, Lslea and LsP5CS) and ultra-structural changes. Theis review identifies certain lesser explored areas such as molecular and ultra-structural changes where further research is needed for better understanding of symbiosis with reference to salt stress for optimum usage of this technology in the field on a large scale.

Emperor penguins, Aptenodytes forsteri , use this behaviour to ensure their survival and reproduction during the Antarctic winter. An emperor penguin colony consists of a dynamic mosaic of compact zones, the so-called huddles, included in a looser network of individuals. To maximize energy savings, birds should adjust their huddling behaviour according to environmental conditions. Here, we examined the dynamics of emperor penguin aggregations, based on photo and video records, in relation to climatic factors. Environmental temperature, wind and solar radiation were the main factors contributing to huddle formation. The analysis of individual movements showed that birds originating from loose aggregations continually joined huddles. Sometimes, a small number of birds induced a movement that propagated to the entire huddle, causing its breakup within 2 min and releasing birds, which then integrated into looser aggregations. Different parts of the colony therefore appeared to continually exchange individuals in response to environmental conditions. A likely explanation is that individuals in need of warmth join huddles, whereas individuals seeking to dissipate heat break huddles apart. The regular growth and decay of huddles operates as pulses through which birds gain, conserve or lose heat. Originally proposed to account for reducing energy expenditure, the concept of social thermoregulation appears to cover a highly dynamic phenomenon that fulfils a genuine regulatory function in emperor penguins.",0.016070316,0.016845815,0.022103274,0.010634951,0.014768614,0.041175567,0.026166758,0.023524543,0.016414946,0.028907001,0.015467482,0.016399862,0.02045568,0.01394201,0.009299384,0.03705419,0.01975599,0.012845022,0.010306189,0.032252748,0.025418349,0.014160978,0.8669362,0.016241752,0.018769767,0.02386608,0.020356435,0.02315977,0.9037421,"['ou', 'hymenoptera']","[0.162162162162162, 0.027027027027027]","[1.0, 0.16666666666666602]"

This would result in a hydrodynamic suction on the bottom for catching prey immediately or during the next sweep besides providing some extra benefits. The basic assumptions appear to be erroneous. (1) A spoonbill does not mainly feed on small, benthic invertebrates, but mainly on nekton such as fish and shrimps. (2) The inner surface of the upper mandible of a spoonbill is not concave but convex. (3) During feeding, a spoonbill does not keep its bill tip close to the bottom independent of the water depth. The outcomes of the tests supporting the hypothesis do not hold and the suggested benefits are dubious. Therefore, we reject the hypothesis and the claim that the bill of a spoonbill is used as a hydrofoil. The discussed paper tried to give an explanation of the behaviour of a bird with the help of hydrodynamic formulae. The fundamental mistake in the paper is that the use of the formulae is based on wrong assumptions concerning the food of the bird, its feeding behaviour as well as its anatomical details. The tests with a bird kept in captivity suggesting a proof of the rightness of the hypothesis lack a proper connection to the situation in the wild. Spoonbills (Aves: Ciconiiformes: Threskiornithidae, genus Platalea) are large wading birds characterised by their extremely flattened bills that are widened in the distal parts. The six species are very similar in shape and behaviour, mainly differing in size, colour of legs, bills and other bare parts, and in distribution (Matheu and del Hoyo 1992).

It has recently been shown that the hairs covering the ant’s dorsal body part are responsible for its silvery appearance. The hairs have a triangular cross-section with two corrugated surfaces allowing a high optical reflection in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) range of the spectrum while maximizing heat emissivity in the mid-infrared (MIR). Those two effects account for remarkable thermoregulatory properties, enabling the ant to maintain a lower thermal steady state and to cope with the high temperature of its natural habitat. In this paper, we further investigate how geometrical optical and high reflection properties account for the bright silver color of C. bombycina. Using optical ray-tracing models and attenuated total reflection (ATR) experiments, we show that, for a large range of incidence angles, total internal reflection (TIR) conditions are satisfied on the basal face of each hair for light entering and exiting through its upper faces. The reflection properties of the hairs are further enhanced by the presence of the corrugated surface, giving them an almost total specular reflectance for most incidence angles. We also show that hairs provide an almost 10-fold increase in light reflection, and we confirm experimentally that they are responsible for a lower internal body temperature under incident sunlight. Overall, this study improves our understanding of the optical mechanisms responsible for the silver color of C. bombycina and the remarkable thermoregulatory properties of the hair coat covering the ant’s body.",0.018901162,0.7738633,0.018058408,0.02667563,0.012531112,0.033909667,0.021946386,0.018542338,0.012011096,0.01528857,0.018072272,0.013242914,0.015298308,0.018896565,0.009254362,0.016146153,0.01565992,0.020213956,0.016189432,0.019904975,0.022390192,0.01600067,0.9223369,0.009338745,0.022091815,0.025592705,0.01867016,0.021306528,0.023552287,"['calopteryx haemorrhoidalis', 'hetaerina cruentata', 'calopterygidae']","[0.02127659574468, 0.02127659574468, 0.02127659574468]","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0]"

In the present study, an effort was made to investigate the effect of physio-chemical parameters on the silver nanoparticle formation with the fungus Chrysosporium tropicum Carmichael and Fusarium oxysporum Schltdl. Approach: The possibilities to manipulating the geometry of silver nanoparticles by altering the key growth parameters such as pH, temperature, concentrations and time have been explored. The effect of AgNO3 with the cell free extract of fungi and time, temperature, pH with the formation of silver has also been investigated. The presence of nanosilver has been carried out with the Micro-scan reader and has been confirmed by X-Rays Diffractometer (XRD). The micrographs of the silver nanoparticles have been evaluated through the Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) and confirmed by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The effect of concentrations with response to time, temperature and pH has studied with the help of Micro-scan reader and their microstructure analyzed by TEM and SEM. Results: It was observed that fungus C. tropicum and F. oxysporum Schltdl significantly activate the extra-cellular production of silver nanoparticles. The different sized and spherical shaped nanoparticles have been formed in different strains. With the increase in concentration, the absorbance increased with response to time (24-120h) and temperature. Significantly, the pH was found decreasing with the increase of absorbance. Conclusion: We presume that these changes initiate new geometry of nanosilver in the cell free solutions.

Honey bees live in large eusocial colonies in which a single queen is responsible for reproduction, several thousand sterile female worker bees complete a myriad of tasks to maintain the colony, and several hundred male drones exist only to mate. The “queen substance” [also termed the queen retinue pheromone (QRP)] is an eight-component pheromone that maintains the queen's dominance in the colony. The main component, 9-ODA, acts as a releaser pheromone by attracting workers to the queen and as a primer pheromone by physiologically inhibiting worker ovary development; it also acts as a sex pheromone, attracting drones during mating flights. However, the extent to which social and sexual chemical messages are shared remains unresolved. By using a custom chemosensory-specific microarray and qPCR, we identified four candidate sex pheromone Ors (AmOr10, -11, -18, and -170) from the honey bee genome based on their biased expression in drone antennae. We assayed the pheromone responsiveness of these receptors by using Xenopus oocytes and electrophysiology. AmOr11 responded specifically to 9-ODA (EC50 = 280 ± 31 nM) and not to any of the other seven QRP components, other social pheromones, or floral odors. We did not observe any responses of the other three Ors to any of the eight QRP pheromone components, suggesting 9-ODA is the only QRP component that also acts as a long-distance sex pheromone.",0.01426197,0.008339548,0.013059988,0.012127069,0.005819805,0.008456819,0.007672406,0.033375807,0.04791447,0.021756709,0.011240263,0.9217015,0.010239705,0.009914297,0.009273063,0.021339307,0.007719195,0.011062364,0.021165509,0.01229097,0.014095862,0.020628318,0.017190818,0.02501982,0.009938337,0.021714495,0.003894404,0.013150763,0.014419838,"['emperor penguin', 'aptenodytes', 'penguins', 'aptenodytes forsteri']","[0.043478260869565, 0.021739130434782, 0.08695652173913, 0.0]","[0.5, 0.25, 1.0, 0.0]"

When an insect visits the trap and tilts the mechanosensors on the inner surface, action potentials (APs) are fired. After a moving object elicits two APs, the trap snaps shut, encaging the victim. Panicking preys repeatedly touch the trigger hairs over the subsequent hours, leading to a hermetically closed trap, which via the gland-based endocrine system is flooded by a prey-decomposing acidic enzyme cocktail. Here, we asked the question as to how many times trigger hairs have to be stimulated (e.g., now many APs are required) for the flytrap to recognize an encaged object as potential food, thus making it worthwhile activating the glands. By applying a series of trigger-hair stimulations, we found that the touch hormone jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway is activated after the second stimulus, while more than three APs are required to trigger an expression of genes encoding prey-degrading hydrolases, and that this expression is proportional to the number of mechanical stimulations. A decomposing animal contains a sodium load, and we have found that these sodium ions enter the capture organ via glands. We identified a flytrap sodium channel DmHKT1 as responsible for this sodium acquisition, with the number of transcripts expressed being dependent on the number of mechano-electric stimulations. Hence, the number of APs a victim triggers while trying to break out of the trap identifies the moving prey as a struggling Na+-rich animal and nutrition for the plant.

By retaining insects that strike the web, these spirally arrayed threads allow a spider time to locate and subdue prey. The viscous capture threads spun by modern orb-weaving spiders of the Araneoidea clade replaced the dry, fuzzy cribellar capture threads of the Deinopoidea and feature regularly spaced moist, adhesive droplets. The stickiness of a cribellar thread is limited by its tendency to peel from a surface after the adhesion generated at the edges of contact is exceeded. In this study we test the hypothesis that viscous thread overcomes this limitation by implementing a suspension bridge mechanism (SBM) that recruits the adhesion of multiple thread droplets. We do so by using contact plates of four widths to measure the stickiness of six species' viscous threads whose profiles range from small, closely spaced droplets to large, widely spaced droplets. The increased stickiness registered by an increased number of thread droplets supports the operation of a SBM. However, the accompanying decrease in mean per droplet adhesion shows that droplets interior to the edges of thread contact contribute successively less adhesion. Models developed from these data suggest that the suspension bridge mechanism is limited to a span of approximately 12 droplets.",0.016918862,0.026117798,0.032242816,0.013089005,0.9040903,0.023844533,0.052339014,0.040241662,0.031251743,0.07038976,0.014673703,0.009172574,0.023903338,0.024604727,0.8551578,0.018567173,0.022294972,0.028660966,0.02189778,0.013122808,0.032983802,0.017220506,0.018789249,0.035051055,0.06111064,0.016293831,0.81888515,0.028171482,0.015199981,[],[],[]

However, there is also conflict between mutualists, because their interests are not perfectly aligned. In addition, most mutualisms are exploited by parasites. Here, we study the interplay between cooperation, conflict and parasitism in the mutualism between fig trees and their pollinator wasps. Conflict occurs because each fig ovary can nurture either one seed or one pollinator offspring and, while fig trees benefit directly from seeds and pollinator offspring (pollen vectors), pollinators only benefit directly from pollinator offspring. The mechanism(s) of conflict resolution is debated, but must explain the widespread observation that pollinators develop in inner, and seeds in outer, layers of fig flowers. We recently suggested a role for non-pollinating figs wasps (NPFWs) that are natural enemies or competitors of the pollinators and lay their eggs through the fig wall. Most NPFW offspring develop in outer and middle layer flowers, suggesting that inner flowers provide enemy-free space for pollinator offspring. Here, we test the hypothesis that NPFWs cannot reach inner flowers, by measuring wasp and fig morphology at the species-specific times of NPFW attack in the field. We found that three species of Sycoscapter and Philotrypesis wasps that parasitise pollinators could reach 34–73%, 75–92% and 82–97% of fig ovaries, respectively. Meanwhile, Eukobelea and Pseudidarnes gall-formers, despite having shorter ovipositors, can access almost all fig flowers (93–99% and 100%), because they attack smaller (younger) fig fruits. Our mechanistic results from ovipositing wasps support spatial patterns of wasp offspring segregation within figs to suggest that inner ovules provide enemy-free-space for pollinators. This may contribute to mutualism stability by helping select for pollinators to avoid laying eggs where they are likely to be parasitised. These outer flowers then remain free to develop as seeds, promoting mutualism persistence.",0.029308643,0.019447157,0.007231781,0.23476127,0.010967934,0.007007772,0.006334559,0.010449173,0.005237443,0.015564809,0.007164996,0.014985601,0.008544412,0.6258746,0.01222729,0.00784553,0.012181991,0.012189355,0.0497303,0.006545215,0.004711451,0.048914734,0.008076178,0.01564763,0.011971636,0.008310012,0.011816361,0.013222946,0.010758928,"['arthropods', 'spiders']","[0.015873015873015, 0.031746031746031]","[0.5, 1.0]"

In Calopteryx haemorrhoidalis, the genital appendages are too wide to penetrate the spermathecae, but males use a different mechanism in which the aedeagus stimulates the vaginal sensilla that control spermathecal sperm release. Since these sensilla are used during egg fertilization and oviposition, it was hypothesized that this function evolved before the male stimulatory ability. I investigated this using Hetaerina cruentata, a species whose position in the Calopterygidae phylogeny is more basal than Calopteryx. Given this position and having determined that males of this species are not able to displace sperm of their conspecific females during copulation, it was expected that H. cruentata females would eject sperm when stimulated with the aedeagi of C. haemorrhoidalis but not when stimulated with the aedeagi of their conspecifics. This prediction was confirmed. In order to investigate the widespread nature of this result, some other Calopteryx species—Calopteryx xanthostoma and Calopteryx virgo—were investigated. The results were similar to those of H. cruentata: conspecific males were unable to stimulate their females, but females ejected sperm when stimulated with C. haemorrhoidalis aedeagi. Morphometric analysis suggests that the mechanistic explanation for the stimulatory ability of C. haemorrhoidalis genitalia is that the aedeagal region that makes contact with the vaginal sensilla is wider in C. haemorrhoidalis than in the other species. These results suggest that the sensory “bias” shown and shared by H. cruentata, Calopteryx splendens, C. virgo, and C. haemorrhoidalis females represents an ancestral condition and that the male stimulatory ability is absent in the evolutionary history of the clade. These pieces of evidence as well as another one presented elsewhere, which indicates that C. haemorrhoidalis males vary in their stimulatory ability, constitute the three criteria for a case of sexual selection via exploitation of a female sensory bias. These results also provide support to the sensory trap hypothesis that indicates that the female bias—in this case, egg fertilization and oviposition—evolved in a context different from sexual selection. Considering that the male genital appendages responsible for physically removing spermathecal sperm in other calopterygids are present in C. haemorrhoidalis, I suggest that males were once able to displace spermathecal sperm physically. Such ability may have been later impeded by a reduction in size of the spermathecal ducts. Possibly, one of the latest events in this sequence is the male’s stimulatory ability. This hypothetical series of events suggests a coevolutionary scenario in which the central actor is the sperm stored in the spermathecae.",0.84730077,0.03484246,0.04745032,0.037454277,0.014985826,0.035867874,0.029382747,0.028515784,0.047137916,0.08749413,0.03687192,0.7458713,0.036660843,0.038192343,0.015140126,0.08152008,0.013415267,0.044645093,0.10866254,0.048973925,0.040498264,0.016029192,0.047805052,0.029226944,0.031718645,0.05861214,0.02787078,0.7683325,0.057585515,['physalia physalis'],[0.04],[1.0]

Here we show that Emperor penguins move collectively in a highly coordinated manner to ensure mobility while at the same time keeping the huddle packed.

Incorporating a five-segment, 17 degree-of-freedom (d.f.) kinematic model of the ostrich hind limb developed from anatomical specimens, we quantified the three-dimensional (3-D) joint axis alignment and joint kinematics during running (at ∼3.3 m s–1) in the largest avian biped, the ostrich. Our analysis revealed that the majority of the segment motion during running in the ostrich occurs in flexion/extension. Importantly, however, the alignment of the average flexion/extension helical axes of the knee and ankle are rotated externally to the direction of travel (37° and 21°, respectively) so that pure flexion and extension at the knee will act to adduct and adbuct the tibiotarsus relative to the plane of movement, and pure flexion and extension at the ankle will act to abduct and adduct the tarsometatarsus relative to the plane of movement. This feature of the limb anatomy appears to provide the major lateral (non-sagittal) displacement of the lower limb necessary for steering the swinging limb clear of the stance limb and replaces what would otherwise require greater adduction/abduction and/or internal/external rotation, allowing for less complex joints, musculoskeletal geometry and neuromuscular control. Significant rotation about the joints' non-flexion/extension axes nevertheless occurs over the running stride. In particular, hip abduction and knee internal/external and varus/valgus motion may further facilitate limb clearance during the swing phase, and substantial non-flexion/extension movement at the knee is also observed during stance. Measurement of 3-D segment and joint motion in birds will be aided by the use of functionally determined axes of rotation rather than assumed axes, proving important when interpreting the biomechanics and motor control of avian bipedalism.",0.013251117,0.011598679,0.014214279,0.005561931,0.008395894,0.013736286,0.008835049,0.009829879,0.011693803,0.014870038,0.004327328,0.008473224,0.010568714,0.008656891,0.007976014,0.012930395,0.01312985,0.005756856,0.004649906,0.012748171,0.017139975,0.005883043,0.018191528,0.008527769,0.01031841,0.009227078,0.012981745,0.009990926,0.91089296,"['plants', 'higher plants']","[0.02127659574468, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0]"

In insects, the campaniform sensillum is a hole extending through the cuticle arranged such that its shape changes in response to loads. The shape change is rotated through 90° by the suspension of a bell-shaped cap whose deflection is detected by a cell beneath the cuticle. It can be sensitive to displacements of the order of 1 nm. The essential morphology, a hole formed in a plate of fibrous composite material, was modelled by Skordos et al. who showed that global deformation of the plate (which can be flat, curved or a tube) induces higher local deformation of the hole due to its locally higher compliance. Further developments reported here show that this approach can be applied to groups of holes relative to their orientation.The morphology of the sensillum in insects suggests that greater sensitivity can be achieved by arranging several holes in a regular pattern; that if the hole is oval it can be “aimed” to sense specific strain directions; and that either by controlling the shape of the hole or its relationship with other holes it can have a tuned response to dynamic strains.We investigate space applications in which novel bio-inspired strain sensors could successfully be used.",0.00867638,0.006956725,0.003780562,0.00236042,0.5898042,0.00611939,0.075355954,0.006141758,0.005516226,0.006571844,0.005658883,0.002500224,0.00550402,0.003818985,0.006106229,0.011014008,0.010507449,0.006100878,0.004483432,0.003837985,0.023490904,0.00667467,0.009089408,0.005226268,0.008107699,0.009868192,0.08702249,0.010542841,0.026157744,['gekko'],[0.07692307692307601],[1.0]

Realistic wing kinematics are adopted in the numerical model by reconstructing the wing motion from high-speed imaging data of the bird. Lift history and the three-dimensional flow pattern around the wing in full stroke cycles are captured in the simulation. Significant asymmetry is observed for lift production within a stroke cycle. In particular, the downstroke generates about 2.5 times as much vertical force as the upstroke, a result that confirms the estimate based on the measurement of the circulation in a previous experimental study. Associated with lift production is the similar power imbalance between the two half strokes. Further analysis shows that in addition to the angle of attack, wing velocity and surface area, drag-based force and wing–wake interaction also contribute significantly to the lift asymmetry. Though the wing–wake interaction could be beneficial for lift enhancement, the isolated stroke simulation shows that this benefit is buried by other opposing effects, e.g. presence of downwash.

Therefore, hydraulic pressure generated in the prosoma provides leg extension. For decades, this mechanism was held responsible for the generation of the majority of the ground reaction forces, particularly in the hind legs. During propulsion, the front leg pairs must shorten whereas the hind legs have to be extended. Assuming that hind legs are essentially driven by hydraulics, their force vectors must pass the leg joints ventrally. However, at least in accelerated escape manoeuvres, we show here for the large cursorial spider species Ancylometes concolor that these force vectors, when projected into the leg plane, pass all leg joints dorsally.

This review offers insight into the working principles of shooting mechanisms in fungi, plants, and animals in the light of the specific functional demands that these mechanisms fulfill. Methods We systematically searched the literature using Scopus and Web of Knowledge to retrieve articles about solid projectiles that either are produced in the body of the organism or belong to the body and undergo a ballistic phase. The shooting mechanisms were categorized based on the energy management prior to and during shooting. Results Shooting mechanisms were identified with projectile masses ranging from 1·10−9 mg in spores of the fungal phyla Ascomycota and Zygomycota to approximately 10,300 mg for the ballistic tongue of the toad Bufo alvarius. The energy for shooting is generated through osmosis in fungi, plants, and animals or muscle contraction in animals. Osmosis can be induced by water condensation on the system (in fungi), or water absorption in the system (reaching critical pressures up to 15.4 atmospheres; observed in fungi, plants, and animals), or water evaporation from the system (reaching up to −197 atmospheres; observed in plants and fungi). The generated energy is stored as elastic (potential) energy in cell walls in fungi and plants and in elastic structures in animals, with two exceptions: (1) in the momentum catapult of Basidiomycota the energy is stored in a stalk (hilum) by compression of the spore and droplets and (2) in Sphagnum energy is mainly stored in compressed air. Finally, the stored energy is transformed into kinetic energy of the projectile using a catapult mechanism delivering up to 4,137 J/kg in the osmotic shooting mechanism in cnidarians and 1,269 J/kg in the muscle-powered appendage strike of the mantis shrimp Odontodactylus scyllarus. The launch accelerations range from 6.6g in the frog Rana pipiens to 5,413,000g in cnidarians, the launch velocities from 0.1 m/s in the fungal phylum Basidiomycota to 237 m/s in the mulberry Morus alba, and the launch distances from a few thousands of a millimeter in Basidiomycota to 60 m in the rainforest tree Tetraberlinia moreliana. The mass-specific power outputs range from 0.28 W/kg in the water evaporation mechanism in Basidiomycota to 1.97·109 W/kg in cnidarians using water absorption as energy source. Discussion and conclusions The magnitude of accelerations involved in shooting is generally scale-dependent with the smaller the systems, discharging the microscale projectiles, generating the highest accelerations. The mass-specific power output is also scale dependent, with smaller mechanisms being able to release the energy for shooting faster than larger mechanisms, whereas the mass-specific work delivered by the shooting mechanism is mostly independent of the scale of the shooting mechanism. Higher mass-specific work-values are observed in osmosis-powered shooting mechanisms (≤ 4,137 J/kg) when compared to muscle-powered mechanisms (≤ 1,269 J/kg). The achieved launch parameters acceleration, velocity, and distance, as well as the associated delivered power output and work, thus depend on the working principle and scale of the shooting mechanism.",0.00998911,0.010926975,0.006204808,0.002617547,0.016476566,0.006839177,0.010787025,0.005253812,0.002433613,0.003622147,0.005253506,0.003992208,0.00573886,0.005918746,0.006200111,0.006426358,0.019521981,0.010894401,0.04445238,0.006278548,0.03852742,0.00386699,0.022045074,0.006606017,0.010147985,0.002563732,0.0740555,0.011957808,0.019146733,[],[],[]

The heron's capture rate of small stationary underwater prey from a variety of angles was high, indicating an ability to correct for refraction. Two distinct phases were described during head movement: i) ‘Pre-strike’ (mean path angle 60° to the vertical, mean velocity 52 cm/s). ii) ‘Strike’ (mean path angle 33°, mean velocity 270 cm/s). When prey was unsubmerged the two phases were less distinct (‘pre-strike’ 47°, 62 cm/s; ‘strike’ 42°, 154 cm/s). The point of change between phases (STR) was assumed to be the point at which corrections for refraction were performed. Calculated disparities between real and apparent prey positions at STR may reach 10 cm. At STR, highly significant correlations were found between i) the heron's eye height above the water, and prey depth, ii) the apparent prey depth and real prey depth.

The first steps of the light phase of photosynthesis, capture of light quanta and primary charge separation processes are particularly well-tuned. In plants, these primary events that take place within the photosystems possess remarkable quantum efficiency, reaching 80% and 100% in photosystems II and I respectively. This paper presents a view on the organisation of a natural light harvesting machine—the antenna of the photosystem II of higher plants. It explains the key principles of biological antenna design and the strategies of adaptation to light environment which have evolved over millions of years. This article argues that the high efficiency of the light harvesting antenna and its control are intimately interconnected owing to the molecular design of the pigment–proteins it is built of, enabling high pigment density combined with the long excited-state lifetime. The protein plays the role of a programmed solvent, accommodating high quantities of pigments, while ensuring their orientations and interaction yields are optimised to efficiently transfer energy to the reaction centres, simultaneously avoiding energy losses due to concentration quenching. The minor group of pigments, the xanthophylls, play a central role in the regulation of light harvesting, defining the antenna efficiency and thus its abilities to simultaneously provide energy to photosystem II and protect itself from excess light damage. Xanthophyll hydrophobicity was found to be a key factor controlling chlorophyll efficiency by modulating pigment–pigment and pigment–protein interactions. Xanthophylls also endow the light harvesting antenna with the remarkable ability to memorise photosystem II light exposure—a light counter principle. Indeed, this type of light harvesting regulation displays hysteretic behaviour, typically observed during electromagnetic induction of ferromagnetic materials, the polarization of ferroelectric materials and the deformation of semi-elastic materials. The photosynthetic antenna is thus a magnificent example of how nature utilises the principles of physics to achieve its goal—extremely efficient, robust, autonomic and yet flexible light harvesting.",0.009623604,0.037841734,0.010712955,0.005445746,0.011315648,0.003166941,0.00279538,0.04548187,0.015093929,0.008256755,0.003051233,0.015014473,0.005327825,0.004748996,0.003193924,0.002892374,0.003487205,0.042130772,0.015717726,0.003423794,0.005227882,0.021010673,0.007633586,0.004089713,0.004548739,0.002224634,0.005509494,0.005240229,0.004838661,['temnothorax albipennis'],[0.031746031746031],[1.0]

Recent evidence suggests that some pigments in bird feathers function not just as colour generators, but also preserve plumage integrity by increasing the resistance of feather keratin to bacterial degradation. We exposed a variety of colourful parrot feathers to feather-degrading Bacillus licheniformis and found that feathers with red psittacofulvins degraded at about the same rate as those with melanin and more slowly than white feathers, which lack pigments. Blue feathers, in which colour is based on the microstructural arrangement of keratin, air and melanin granules, and green feathers, which combine structural blue with yellow psittacofulvins, degraded at a rate similar to that of red and black feathers.

The function of the mucous cocoons that many parrotfishes and wrasses sleep in, while long used as a classical example of antipredator behaviour, remains unresolved. Ectoparasitic gnathiid isopods (Gnathiidae), which feed on the blood of fish, are removed by cleaner fish during the day; however, it is unclear how parrotfish and wrasse avoid gnathiid attacks at night. To test the novel hypothesis that mucous cocoons protect against gnathiids, we exposed the coral reef parrotfish Chlorurus sordidus (Scaridae) with and without cocoons to gnathiids overnight and measured the energetic content of cocoons. Fish without mucous cocoons were attacked more by gnathiids than fish with cocoons. The energetic content of mucous cocoons was estimated as 2.5 per cent of the fish's daily energy budget fish.

The study reveals that mycorrhiza-mediated attenuation of oxidative stress in fenugreek plants is due to enhanced activity of antioxidant enzymes and higher concentrations of antioxidant molecules. However, the significant effect of G. intraradices colonization on individual antioxidant molecules and enzymes varied with plant tissue, salinity level, and DoS. The significant effect of G. intraradices colonization on antioxidative enzymes was more evident at 1DAT in both leaves and roots, while the concentrations of antioxidant molecules were significantly influenced at 14DAT. It is proposed that AM symbiosis can improve antioxidative defense systems of plants through higher SOD activity in M plants, facilitating rapid dismutation of O2- to H2O2, and subsequent prevention of H2O2 build-up by higher activities of CAT, APX, and PX. The potential of G. intraradices to ameliorate oxidative stress generated in fenugreek plants by salinity was more evident at higher intensities of salt stress.",0.020205328,0.005791449,0.011617933,0.018658184,0.016808137,0.01151326,0.007542892,0.012345265,0.012877196,0.007478226,0.86980176,0.014034281,0.02867991,0.005021779,0.010348839,0.022379039,0.005172592,0.008435035,0.01377078,0.013457864,0.017958859,0.012075461,0.03334915,0.013945105,0.012623237,0.016416624,0.009319552,0.009268293,0.006802997,"['fish', 'fishes']","[0.028846153846153, 0.009615384615384]","[1.0, 0.33333333333333304]"

But no studies to date have tested these claims of drag reduction under dynamic and controlled conditions in which the swimming speed and hydrodynamics of shark skin and skin-like materials can be quantitatively compared with those of controls lacking surface ornamentation or with surfaces in different orientations. We use a flapping foil robotic device that allows accurate determination of the self-propelled swimming (SPS) speed of both rigid and flexible membrane-like foils made of shark skin and two biomimetic models of shark skin to measure locomotor performance. We studied the SPS speed of real shark skin, a silicone riblet material with evenly spaced ridges and a Speedo® ‘shark skin-like’ swimsuit fabric attached to rigid flat-plate foils and when made into flexible membrane-like foils. We found no consistent increase in swimming speed with Speedo® fabric, a 7.2% increase with riblet material, whereas shark skin membranes (but not rigid shark skin plates) showed a mean 12.3% increase in swimming speed compared with the same skin foils after removing the denticles. Deformation of the shark skin membrane is thus crucial to the drag-reducing effect of surface denticles. Digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) of the flow field surrounding moving shark skin foils shows that skin denticles promote enhanced leading-edge suction, which might have contributed to the observed increase in swimming speed. Shark skin denticles might thus enhance thrust, as well as reduce drag.",0.039633814,0.019511128,0.015311502,0.012517961,0.01737682,0.8706817,0.009378178,0.014063396,0.04519639,0.03391337,0.025163624,0.01352317,0.024082528,0.01365979,0.013931905,0.013814678,0.025064776,0.02217249,0.01240755,0.9034699,0.013925454,0.014369289,0.03179795,0.03066743,0.02186558,0.021778429,0.019456867,0.019101951,0.03323524,[],[],[]

Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, the two most common cyanobacteria, account for 30% of global carbon fixation (through the photosynthetic process in which sugars are manufactured from carbon dioxide and water). By drawing on natural resources, these microbes use photosystems (PS) I and II (the two reaction centers in photosynthesis) to harness energy. 
 
Intriguingly, some viruses that infect cyanobacteria (called cyanophage), carry genes that encode two PSII core reaction-center proteins: PsbA (the most rapidly turned over core protein in all oxygen-yielding photosynthetic organisms) and PsbD (which forms a complex with PsbA). By expressing their own copies of psbA and psbD during infection, these cyanophages have managed to co-opt host genes to suit their own purposes: enhancing photosynthesis. It seems likely that they do this in the interests of their own fitness, since cyanophage production is optimal when photosynthesis is maintained during infection. 
 
Until recently, only a small sample of cyanophages had been examined, leaving open the questions of how widespread PSII genes are in these organisms and where the genes came from. To answer these questions, Matthew Sullivan, Debbie Lindell, Sallie Chisholm, and colleagues examined a pool of 33 cyanophage isolates (cultured from samples collected from the Sargasso Sea and the Red Sea), along with data already available for nine other cyanophages, for the presence of psbA and psbD genes. They found psbA was present in 88% and psbD in 50% of the cyanophages studied. By analyzing the sequences of these genes along with those from Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus host genes, they reconstructed the evolutionary history of how the PSII genes entered the phage genomes. 
 
Cyanophages are divided morphologically into three main families (Podoviridae, Myoviridae, and Siphoviridae). Looking at the distributions of the PSII genes across the different families, Sullivan, Lindell, et al. saw that psbA was present in all myoviruses and all Prochlorococcus podoviruses, but not in Prochlorococcus siphoviruses or Synechococcus podoviruses. The high levels of sequence conservation between the different cyanophages suggest that this gene is probably functional and that it is likely to increase the reproductive fitness of the phage. The length of the latent period may impact the distribution pattern of psbA among these phage groups. However, more information about the physiological characteristics of cyanophages is needed to further investigate these possibilities. 
 
The second gene, psbD, was less prolific but was seen in four of the 20 Prochlorococcus myoviruses and 17 of the 20 Synechococcus myoviruses examined—all of which also encoded psbA. Myoviruses are known to infect a wider range of cyanobacteria than the other cyanophage families. Indeed, when investigated, the psbD-encoding myoviruses correlated with those known to have a broader host range. Perhaps the co-opting of both PSII genes ensures a functional PsbA–PsbD protein complex to enhance infection for these cyanophages that are able to infect a wider range of hosts. 
 
To determine when the PSII genes had been transferred into the phage and from where, Sullivan, Lindell, et al. investigated the nucleotide sequences of psbA and psbD from both Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus host and cyanophage. Using meticulous sequence analyses and standard statistical methods, they generated phylogenetic trees to explain the evolutionary history of these two PSII genes. 
 
By analyzing the clusters of sequence types within the resulting tree, the authors saw evidence that psbA was transferred from the cyanobacteria host genome into the phage genome on four independent occasions and two separate occasions for psbD. Exchange events were generally host-range specific, meaning that Prochlorococcus genes transferred to Prochlorococcus phages, and so on. However, a few intriguing exceptions, where genes did not cluster with their hosts, were observed; these might result from genetic exchange between members of two different phage families (one of broader host range) during co-infection of the same host. 
 
Sullivan, Lindell, et al. were also able to use their dataset to investigate a previous suggestion that alterations in the nucleotide distributions within individual PSII genes (creating a kind of patchwork gene) demonstrate that intragenic recombination has taken place. Indeed, they confirm that this occurs among Synechococcus myoviruses and Prochlorococcus podoviruses. In some cases involving Synechococcus, intragenic recombination appears to have happened in both host-to-phage and phage-to-host directions for both genes; and, for some Prochlorococcus genes, DNA from an unknown source also seems to have been inserted. Occasionally, intragenic exchanges are also seen between Synechococcus hosts. 
 
The authors compare their cultured results to those from wild phage sequences from the Pacific Ocean and see that much of the natural diversity is similar to the sequences from the cyanophage isolates, despite their origination from different ocean basins. Overall, therefore, a considerable amount of genetic shuffling takes place within these two PSII genes in cyanophages, and this creates a reservoir of photosynthetic diversity from which both host and phage are likely to benefit. This study offers a compelling example of global-scale microbial and phage co-evolution that likely influences the biological success of these prolific marine organisms.",0.030872934,0.01138946,0.007152592,0.014433832,0.004398361,0.004261854,0.001952021,0.0689336,0.005368569,0.005192269,0.02760159,0.016662462,0.028733835,0.00392228,0.013803042,0.004347199,0.002363825,0.013517739,0.012500514,0.00496698,0.004786337,0.009737575,0.00317133,0.042926375,0.004297439,0.004679261,0.002658655,0.003772809,0.004195626,[],[],[]

As reported in the literature, these bees have suffered no harm from as much as 2 mg/bee, which is in the per-cent range of the body weight. In 1979, individuals of E. purpurata were captured as they collected DDT from walls of remote, rural houses in Brazil. Reported herein are quantities and identities of DDT, DDT metabolites, and other organohalogen compounds in four samples of bees stored since 1979. The concentrations of DDT (sum of p,p'-DDT, -DDE, and -DDD) ranged from 23 to 314 microg/bee which is up to twelve fold higher than the LD(50) value of DDT in the honey bee (Apis mellifera) but significantly lower than the no-effect concentration in E. purpurata. Enantioselective determination confirmed the presence of racemic o,p'-DDT in the four individual samples. GC/ECNI-MS investigation resulted in the detection of low amounts (<1 microg/bee) of PCA, lindane, and chlordane. At higher retention times four unknown compounds were detected with a proposed molecular ion at m/z 498, a non-aromatic hydrocarbon backbone along with the presence of eight chlorine substituents.

In contrast with invasive species that dominate as monotypes, C. stricta supports a diversity of co-occurring species by forming tussocks. Concerns about diversity loss and the potential to restore species-rich tussocks led us to ask how tussocks foster high species richness and affect composition. Our study of 181 tussocks at three sites showed that tussocks structure sedge meadow vegetation by adding both surface area and micro-habitats. Tussocks, which average 15–25 cm tall, increase surface area of an otherwise flat plot by 40%. Species richness was positively correlated with tussock size, but the patterns differed among sites. At a site where water was deep, tussock height was the best predictor of richness; at two other sites, surface area and circumference were the best predictors. Micro-habitats differed in conditions and species composition: tussock tops were high in light, variable in temperature, and high in litter cover. Tussock sides had less litter but more moss; off-tussock areas tended to be aquatic. Of the 56 taxa found, 34 showed significant affinities for one or more micro-habitats. Of these, four species occurred primarily on tops, several extended from tops to lower levels, seven aquatic taxa preferred areas off-tussocks, and one species specialized in tussock sides. Over the 2004 growing season, species richness increased in an additive process, from 35 species in May to 56 in September 2004. Cover of litter and moss increased and bare surface decreased with season, but only seven of the 34 taxa with micro-site preferences expanded their distributions as the September drawdown exposed the off-tussock micro-habitat. We conclude that tussocks enhance species richness in three ways, by increasing surface area, by providing multiple micro-habitats, and by undergoing seasonal changes in composition. Our detailed data on plant-diversity support by large tussocks form a benchmark for tussock meadow conservation, as well as a target for restoration of degraded meadows.",0.027230399,0.007601664,0.43839186,0.005126841,0.007066033,0.005676345,0.006203708,0.010227188,0.017522367,0.005545986,0.007274804,0.005228425,0.008536405,0.005930611,0.003987817,0.011066825,0.006921983,0.002911521,0.005718791,0.008303644,0.003089375,0.005565796,0.036702476,0.012943908,0.004924845,0.004650395,0.002355048,0.006283116,0.018915107,"['bamboo', 'bamboos']","[0.08695652173913, 0.043478260869565]","[1.0, 0.5]"

Tension wood fibers that develop on one side of the stem have an increased potency to shrink compared with fibers on the opposite side, thus creating a bending moment. It is believed that the gelatinous (G) cell wall layer containing almost pure cellulose of tension wood fibers is pivotal to their shrinking. By analyzing saccharide composition and linkage in isolated G-layers of poplar, we found that they contain some matrix components in addition to cellulose, of which xyloglucan is the most abundant. Xyloglucan, xyloglucan endo-transglycosylase (XET) activity and xyloglucan endo-transglycosylase/hydrolase (XTH) gene products were detected in developing G-layers by labeling using CCRC-M1 monoclonal antibody, in situ incorporation of XXXG-SR and the polyclonal antibody to poplar PttXET16-34, respectively, indicating that xyloglucan is incorporated into the G-layer during its development. Moreover, several XTH transcripts were altered and were generally up-regulated in developing tension wood compared with normal wood. In mature G-fibers, XTH gene products were detected in the G-layers while the XET activity was evident in the adjacent S(2) wall layer. We propose that XET activity is essential for G-fiber shrinking by repairing xyloglucan cross-links between G- and S(2)-layers and thus maintaining their contact. Surprisingly, XTH gene products and XET activity persisted in mature G-fibers for several years, suggesting that the enzyme functions after cell death repairing the cross-links as they are being broken during the shrinking process.",0.060248557,0.03131198,0.8603471,0.021467164,0.84430367,0.014355263,0.07071655,0.81973666,0.08498917,0.03962366,0.024916869,0.03203118,0.028726265,0.030065333,0.04435712,0.033910174,0.03165627,0.018477047,0.040544428,0.013841006,0.034563918,0.013627628,0.028067783,0.09233468,0.037192237,0.022750217,0.028146282,0.035046242,0.04696702,[],[],[]

In this study, we provide evidence that rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss voluntarily alter their body kinematics when interacting with vortices present in the environment that are not self-generated. To demonstrate this, we measured axial swimming kinematics in response to changes in known hydrodynamic wake characteristics. We compared trout swimming in the Kármán street behind different diameter cylinders (2.5 and 5 cm) at two flow speeds (2.5 and 4.5 L s-1, where L is total body length) to trout swimming in the free stream and in the cylinder bow wake. Trout swimming behind cylinders adopt a distinctive, previously undescribed pattern of movement in order to hold station, which we term the Kármán gait. During this gait, body amplitudes and curvatures are much larger than those of trout swimming at an equivalent flow velocity in the absence of a cylinder. Tail-beat frequency is not only lower than might be expected for a trout swimming in the reduced flow behind a cylinder, but also matches the vortex shedding frequency of the cylinder. Therefore, in addition to choosing to be in the slower flow velocity offered behind a cylinder (drafting), trout are also altering their body kinematics to synchronize with the shed vortices (tuning), using a mechanism that may not involve propulsive locomotion. This behavior is most distinctive when cylinder diameter is large relative to fish length. While tuning, trout have a longer body wavelength than the prescribed wake wavelength, indicating that only certain regions of the body may need to be oriented in a consistent manner to the oncoming vortices. Our results suggest that fish can capture energy from vortices generated by the environment to maintain station in downstream flow. Interestingly, trout swimming in front of a cylinder display lower tail-beat amplitudes and body wave speeds than trout subjected to any of the other treatments, implying that the bow wake may be the most energetically favorable region for a fish to hold station near a cylinder.",0.022371495,0.009576652,0.012192939,0.006535558,0.007960036,0.058227405,0.008115111,0.007771284,0.019999063,0.01797545,0.01468676,0.010957479,0.014636362,0.005181522,0.008741826,0.016863687,0.015195448,0.017061152,0.008218534,0.8827965,0.008299428,0.011430015,0.021699242,0.021012545,0.010672375,0.012730474,0.008886823,0.022915717,0.018620826,"['phengodidae', 'coleoptera']","[0.02, 0.02]","[1.0, 1.0]"

The biomechanics of discharge may involve an abrupt change in the center of mass associated with the coalescence of Buller's drop and the spore. However this process occurs so rapidly that the launch of the ballistospore has never been visualized. Here we report ultra high-speed video recordings of the earliest events of spore dispersal using the yeast Itersonilia perplexans and the distantly related jelly fungus Auricularia auricula. Images taken at camera speeds of up to 100,000 frames/ s demonstrate that ballistospore discharge does involve the coalescence of Buller's drop and the spore. Recordings of I. perplexans demonstrate that although coalescence may result from the directed collapse of Buller's drop onto the spore, it also may involve the movement of the spore toward the drop. The release of surface tension at coalescence provides the energy and directional momentum to propel the drop and spore away from the fungus. Analyses show that ballistospores launch into the air at initial accelerations in excess of 10,000 g.

This result, along with theoretical calculations of the characteristic poroelastic relaxation frequency, f(p), (approximately 50-90Hz) suggested that this time-dependent behavior was governed primarily by fluid flow-dependent poroelasticity, rather than flow-independent viscoelastic processes associated with the solid matrix. |E*(f)| increased, (f) decreased, and the hydraulic permeability, k, decreased with time in culture and with growth factor treatment.

Even though diverse organisms synthesize alkanes, synthesis pathways have remained elusive. Now Schirmer et al. (p. 559) describe an alkane biosynthesis pathway in cyanobacteria that converts intermediates of fatty acid metabolism to alkanes and alkenes. Heterologous expression of the biosynthetic genes resulted in production of alkanes in Escherichia coli. This pathway is likely to be a valuable tool in the production of biofuels. Alkane biosynthesis genes were identified in cyanobacteria and engineered into Escherichia coli for recombinant hydrocarbon production. Alkanes, the major constituents of gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel, are naturally produced by diverse species; however, the genetics and biochemistry behind this biology have remained elusive. Here we describe the discovery of an alkane biosynthesis pathway from cyanobacteria. The pathway consists of an acyl–acyl carrier protein reductase and an aldehyde decarbonylase, which together convert intermediates of fatty acid metabolism to alkanes and alkenes. The aldehyde decarbonylase is related to the broadly functional nonheme diiron enzymes.

Lung ventilation in the aquatic salamander Necturus maculosus was examined by means of cineradiography, measurement of buccal and pleuroperitoneal cavity pressures, and electromyography of hypaxial musculature. In deoxygenated water Necturus periodically rises to the surface, opens its mouth, expands its buccal cavity to draw in fresh air, exhales air from the lungs, closes its mouth, and then compresses its buccal cavity and pumps air into the lungs. Thus Necturus produces only two buccal movements per breath: one expansion and one compression. Necturus shares the use of this two-stroke buccal pump with lungfishes, frogs and other salamanders. The ubiquitous use of this system by basal sarcopterygians is evidence that a two-stroke buccal pump is the primitive lung ventilation mechanism for sarcopterygian vertebrates. In contrast, basal actinopterygian fishes use a four-stroke buccal pump. In these fishes the buccal cavity expands to fill with expired air, compresses to expel the pulmonary air, expands to fill with fresh air, and then compresses for a second time to pump air into the lungs. Whether the sarcopterygian two-stroke buccal pump and the actinopterygian four-stroke buccal pump arose independently, whether both are derived from a single, primitive osteichthyian breathing mechanism, or whether one might be the primitive pattern and the other derived, cannot be determined Although Necturus and lungfishes both use a two-stroke buccal pump, they differ in their expiration mechanics. Unlike a lungfish (Protopterus), Necturus exhales by contracting a portion of its hypaxial trunk musculature (the m. transversus abdominis) to increase pleuroperitoneal pressure. The occurrence of this same expiratory mechanism in amniotes is evidence that the use of hypaxial musculature for expiration, but not for inspiration, is a primitive tetrapod feature. From this observation we hypothesize that aspiration breathing may have evolved in two stages: initially, from pure buccal pumping to the use of trunk musculature for exhalation but not for inspiration (as in Necturus); and secondarily, to the use of trunk musculature for both exhalation and inhalation by costal aspiration (as in amniotes).",0.05489204,0.002315274,0.002674572,0.001842711,0.016942346,0.002668364,0.007068051,0.004879984,0.00244403,0.004647646,0.005051845,0.00244564,0.008452661,0.003009542,0.003369431,0.026295213,0.007887834,0.005839922,0.010919957,0.003556228,0.005472987,0.002119379,0.01033593,0.004898214,0.004386904,0.006036325,0.003485868,0.012851057,0.004451766,[],[],[]

Models typically treat the uptake and degradation of these compounds as if they are mostly unreactive, like other more commonly studied biogenic gases such as ozone. A study by Karl et al. (p. 816, published online 21 October) suggests that VOCs may be more reactive than expected. By monitoring six field sites representing a range of deciduous ecosystems, several oxidized VOCs were found to have high deposition fluxes. Fumigation experiments in the laboratory confirmed that leaves are capable of oxidizing these compounds, and do so through an enzymatic detoxification or stress-response mechanism. Budgets for VOC flux in the atmosphere suggests that, on a global scale, plants may take up significant levels of VOCs in polluted regions, especially in the tropics. Deciduous trees enzymatically remove oxygenated volatile organic compounds from the atmosphere. The biosphere is the major source and sink of nonmethane volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the atmosphere. Gas-phase chemical reactions initiate the removal of these compounds from the atmosphere, which ultimately proceeds via deposition at the surface or direct oxidation to carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide. We performed ecosystem-scale flux measurements that show that the removal of oxygenated VOC via dry deposition is substantially larger than is currently assumed for deciduous ecosystems. Laboratory experiments indicate efficient enzymatic conversion and potential up-regulation of various stress-related genes, leading to enhanced uptake rates as a response to ozone and methyl vinyl ketone exposure or mechanical wounding. A revised scheme for the uptake of oxygenated VOCs, incorporated into a global chemistry-transport model, predicts appreciable regional changes in annual dry deposition fluxes.",0.010627919,0.009666965,0.012593721,0.01402152,0.007968287,0.007998487,0.007174188,0.014279873,0.012012934,0.011262245,0.022409733,0.008086204,0.9018387,0.009093228,0.011436326,0.00542709,0.010049171,0.010772752,0.008517079,0.013371909,0.010340326,0.009698877,0.010882862,0.008220755,0.013161157,0.015066838,0.010822265,0.011512945,0.010598068,['tammar wallaby'],[0.008333333333333],[1.0]

Previously, we cloned the green- (PxGR) and red-emitting (PxRE) luciferases of railroad worms Phrixotrix viviani and P. hirtus[OLE1]. These luciferases were expressed and purified, and their active-site properties were determined. The red-emitting PxRE luciferase displays flash-like kinetics, whereas PxGR luciferase displays slow-type kinetics. The substrate affinities and catalytic efficiency of PxRE luciferase are also higher than those of PxGR luciferase. Fluorescence studies with 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid and 6-p-toluidino-2-naphthalene sulfonic acid showed that the PxRE luciferase luciferin-binding site is more polar than that of PxGR luciferase, and it is sensitive to guanidine. Mutagenesis and modelling studies suggest that several invariant residues in the putative luciferin-binding site of PxRE luciferase cannot interact with excited oxyluciferin. These results suggest that one portion of the luciferin-binding site of the red-emitting luciferase is tighter than that of PxGR luciferase, whereas the other portion could be more open and polar.",0.015654903,0.016216027,0.00693166,0.007904442,0.015958821,0.009670906,0.005228142,0.011463987,0.015820723,0.022029769,0.007771019,0.009487299,0.015647063,0.011199693,0.011575311,0.007627437,0.009188175,0.8815292,0.011659252,0.018549958,0.015097537,0.013058968,0.012618241,0.010625127,0.011537875,0.015361288,0.010760939,0.013266351,0.009378333,[],[],[]

A possible source of new fungicides.,"Seven toxins (F1-F7) were purified from Tityus discrepans scorpion venom on a C18 HPLC column. The compounds were fungitoxic on Macrophomina phaseolina. The molecular masses of F1-F7 were (Da) 1061.1, 7328.8, 7288.3, 7268.5, 7104.6, 6924.6, and 6823.3, respectively. It is not known if F1 is a small peptide or some other kind of organic molecule. Compounds F2-F7 were peptides. The most potent was F7, with a minimal inhibition concentration of 0.4 μg/μL and a concentration for 50% inhibition of 0.13 μg/μL. Fungal esterase activity was abolished by F2, F3, and F5 and inhibited by 89, 60, 58, and 54% by F4, F6, F7, and F1, respectively. F1, F2, F5, and F7 induced an increase on hyphae chitin wall and septum thickness. Peptides F3-F6 induced efflux of the fluorescent dye Na-CoroNa Red complex from hyphae. Only F5 and F6 were inhibited by the prokaryote sodium channel blockers amiloride and mibefradil. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis suggested that F1, F5, F6, and F7 altered sterol biosynthesis either by inhibiting ergosterol biosynthesis or by producing ergosterol analogues. The peptides affect M. phaseolina viability by three mechanisms: decreasing esterase activity, altering Na(+) membrane permeability, and altering wall sterol biosynthesis. It seems that interfering with sterol synthesis is an important mechanism behind the effect of the fungicideal toxins. However, the antifungal effects at short times are indicative of a direct esterase inhibition, which, with the increased membrane leakiness to Na(+), makes the fungus inviable.",0.007230997,0.007227421,0.00519734,0.00519117,0.012517725,0.006032039,0.010524939,0.006095719,0.008402944,0.008623391,0.010109781,0.009920642,0.012831406,0.00755225,0.006938582,0.012073215,0.008598564,0.007072878,0.007772077,0.007432027,0.011487208,0.010567825,0.007902404,0.008596865,0.010083103,0.9424845,0.007103121,0.011190571,0.007455723,"['apocrita', 'hymenopterans', 'hymenoptera']","[0.015873015873015, 0.015873015873015, 0.047619047619047006]","[0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304, 1.0]"

This protein-based material acts as a promiscuous pressure-sensitive adhesive that functions even in wet conditions. We conducted macroscopic tests in air to assess the tensile strength of moist glue (up to 78 +/- 8 kPa) and the shear strength of dry glue (1.7 +/- 0.3 MPa). We also performed nanomechanical measurements in water to determine the adhesion (1.9-7.2 nN or greater), resilience (43-56%), and elastic modulus (170-1035 kPa) of solid glue collected in different ways. Dry glue contains little carbohydrate and consists mainly of protein. The protein complement is rich in Gly (15.8 mol %), Pro (8.8 mol %), and Glu/Gln (14.1 mol %); it also contains some 4-hydroxyproline (4.6 mol %) but no 5-hydroxylysine or 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-Dopa). Denaturing gel electrophoresis of the glue reveals a characteristic pattern of proteins spanning 13-400 kDa. The largest protein (Nb-1R, apparent molecular mass 350-500 kDa) is also the most abundant, and this protein appears to be the key structural component. The solid glue can be dissolved in dilute acids; raising the ionic strength causes the glue components to self-assemble spontaneously into a solid which resembles the starting material. We describe scattering studies on dissolved and solid glue and provide microscopy images of glue surfaces and sections, revealing a porous interior that is consistent with the high water content (85-90 wt %) of moist glue. In addition to compositional similarities with other biological adhesives and well-known elastomeric proteins, the circular dichroism spectrum of dissolved glue is almost identical to that for soluble elastin and electron and scanning probe microscopy images invite comparison with silk fibroins.

How, then, is the energy in a jump (4100–4800 μJ) or kick (1700 μJ) dissipated? A specialised buckling region found in the proximal hind-tibia where the bending moment is high, but not present in the other legs, buckled and allowed the distal part of the tibia to extend. In jumps when a hindleg slipped, it bent by a mean of 23±14 deg at a velocity of 13.4±9.5 deg ms–1; in kicks that failed to contact a target it bent by 32±16 deg at a velocity of 32.9±9.5 deg ms–1. It also buckled 8.5±4.0 deg at a rate of 0.063±0.005 deg ms–1 when the tibia was prevented from flexing fully about the femur in preparation for both these movements. By experimentally buckling this region through 40 deg at velocities of 0.001–0.65 deg ms–1, we showed that one hindleg could store about 870 μJ on bending, of which 210 μJ was dissipated back to the leg on release. A band of blue fluorescence was revealed at the buckling region under UV illumination that had the two key signatures of the elastic protein resilin. A group of campaniform sensilla 300 μm proximal to the buckling region responded to imposed buckling movements. The features of the buckling region show that it can act as a shock absorber as proposed previously when jumping and kicking movements go wrong.",0.027422165,0.033782594,0.035638507,0.03001173,0.16831936,0.042800866,0.09927448,0.023519196,0.018581154,0.036898866,0.061110288,0.027552545,0.063262925,0.031673834,0.0347092,0.019235311,0.049336944,0.041997667,0.03067759,0.033198927,0.8455402,0.024804354,0.040669702,0.037922062,0.88505435,0.023501605,0.75313866,0.079724215,0.060920086,"['ligia oceanica', 'porcellio scaber', 'armadillidium vulgare', 'oniscus asellus']","[0.032258064516129004, 0.0, 0.016129032258064002, 0.016129032258064002]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5]"

Two reasons for this are perhaps paramount. First, the picture of the cell has been transformed from that of a 'wet chemical' melange—'a vessel, filled with a homogeneous solution, in which all chemical processes take place', as Franz Hofmeister put it in 1901—into an image of a sort of fluid factory, a production plant in which molecular machinery works in near-fantastic orchestration to generate complex products from raw materials. This mechanism is self-assembling, self-repairing and self-replicating. The concept of proteins and nucleic acids as 'molecular machines' is now a mainstream one in cell biology. Second, technological advances have made us accustomed to the idea that engineering can be conducted at scales too small to see with the naked eye, yet employing principles—mechanical, electrical, hydraulic, optical, tribological—familiar from the macroscopic world. Molecular electronics and computing, microelectromechanical devices and nanotechnology, are now mainstream concepts, and are validated by at least some degree of physical realization.

However, success in prey capture depends as much on the web glue as on the fibers. Spider silk glue, which is considered one of the strongest and most effective biological glues, is an aqueous solution secreted from the orb weaving spider's aggregate glands and coats the spiral prey capturing threads of their webs. Studies identified the major component of the glue as microscopic nodules made of a glycoprotein. This study describes two newly discovered proteins that form the glue-glycoprotein of the golden orb weaving spider Nephila clavipes . Our results demonstrate that both proteins contain unique 110 amino acid repetitive domains that are encoded by opposite strands of the same DNA sequence. Thus, the genome of the spider encodes two distinct yet functionally related genes by using both strands of an identical DNA sequence. Moreover, the closest match for the nonrepetitive region of one of the proteins is chitin binding proteins. The web glue appears to have evolved a substantial level of sophistication matching that of the spider silk fibers.",0.009955125,0.0116895,0.009000992,0.008924102,0.017514111,0.011466316,0.007355534,0.016265409,0.020230599,0.03432734,0.009858654,0.007729666,0.022253891,0.009634444,0.9118463,0.012499065,0.008180517,0.013089362,0.008973335,0.008546613,0.012136258,0.006633476,0.011687803,0.040006146,0.006886954,0.009284995,0.01633661,0.010379867,0.011688189,[],[],[]

Spiders depend upon these properties for survival, yet the impressive performance of silk is not limited solely to tensile mechanics. Here, we show that silk also exhibits powerful cyclic contractions, allowing it to act as a high performance mimic of biological muscles. These contractions are actuated by changes in humidity alone and repeatedly generate work 50 times greater than the equivalent mass of human muscle. Although we demonstrate that this response is general and occurs weakly in diverse hydrophilic materials, the high modulus of spider silk is such that it generates exceptional force. Furthermore, because this effect already operates at the level of single silk fibers, only 5 μm in diameter, it can easily be scaled across the entire size range at which biological muscles operate. By contrast, the most successful synthetic muscles developed so far are driven by electric voltage, such that they cannot scale easily across large ranges in cross-sectional areas. The potential applicability of silk muscles is further enhanced by our finding that silkworm fibers also exhibit cyclic contraction because they are already available in commercial quantities. The simplicity of using wet or dry air to drive the biomimetic silk muscle fibers and the incredible power generated by silk offer unique possibilities in designing lightweight and compact actuators for robots and micro-machines, new sensors, and green energy production.",0.022847673,0.05001953,0.027873036,0.034062125,0.06378938,0.02728409,0.041980613,0.02946118,0.02384783,0.06926438,0.034045976,0.03635367,0.0498451,0.032446727,0.031814232,0.045530025,0.024360795,0.0379682,0.022370266,0.034963604,0.03863365,0.015064907,0.041498616,0.040609755,0.8704638,0.04549397,0.8352759,0.84244996,0.03526022,"['cyanobacteria', 'salmonella enterica', 'micrococcus luteus', 'pyrobaculum islandicum', 'desulfovibrio sp.', 'bacteria']","[0.013513513513513, 0.006756756756756001, 0.0, 0.006756756756756001, 0.006756756756756001, 0.06081081081081]","[0.22222222222222202, 0.11111111111111101, 0.0, 0.11111111111111101, 0.11111111111111101, 1.0]"

This species produces a luminous display in response to mechanical stimulation caused by encounters with other motile organisms. The light is produced from discrete areas on the snail's body beneath the snail's shell, and must thus overcome this structural barrier to be viewed by an external receiver. The diffusion and transmission efficiency of the shell is greater than a commercial diffuser reference material. Most strikingly, the shell, although opaque and pigmented, selectively diffuses the blue-green wavelength of the species bioluminescence.

Hunting archerfish can strike their targets with precisely aimed water jets (e.g., [8, 9]), but they are also presently thought to be unable to actively control the hydrodynamics of their jets [8-13]. By using specifically trained fish, we were able to monitor several aspects of jet production and propagation as the fish fired at targets over a much wider range of distances than previously explored [10, 13]. We show that jets that have to travel farther also live longer. Furthermore, the time needed until water assembles at the jet tip is not fixed. Rather, it is adjusted so that maximum focusing occurs just before impact. Surprisingly, the fish achieve this by modulating the dynamics of changes in the cross-section of their mouth opening, a mechanism that seems to not have been applied yet in human-built nozzles. The timing adjustments archerfish make in order to powerfully hit targets over an extended range strikingly parallel the situation in the ""uniquely human"" ability of powerful throwing [14-18].

Although some pyrethroids, such as cyfluthrin and lambda-cyhalothrin, are highly toxic to honey bees, the toxicity of tau-fluvalinate is low enough to warrant its use to control parasitic mites inside honey bee colonies. Metabolic insecticide resistance in other insects is mediated by three major groups of detoxifying enzymes: the cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), the carboxylesterases (COEs), and the glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). To test the role of metabolic detoxification in mediating the relatively low toxicity of tau-fluvalinate compared with more toxic pyrethroid insecticides, we examined the effects of piperonyl butoxide (PBO), S,S,S-tributylphosphorotrithioate (DEF), and diethyl maleate (DEM) on the toxicity of these pyrethroids. The toxicity of the three pyrethroids to bees was greatly synergized by the P450 inhibitor PBO and synergized at low levels by the carboxylesterase inhibitor DEF. Little synergism was observed with DEM. These results suggest that metabolic detoxification, especially that mediated by P450s, contributes significantly to honey bee tolerance of pyrethroid insecticides. The potent synergism between tau-fluvalinate and PBO suggests that P450s are especially important in the detoxification of this pyrethroid and explains the ability of honey bees to tolerate its presence.",0.010305353,0.009125021,0.013004207,0.014307802,0.007091599,0.007985241,0.007833039,0.01446948,0.013270821,0.010546737,0.02245475,0.009223047,0.90271324,0.010982187,0.011749965,0.006057086,0.010612473,0.010803278,0.00877586,0.013454211,0.009861839,0.010146567,0.010617181,0.009752554,0.014789777,0.014632843,0.009949562,0.010761558,0.010247093,"['moraceae', 'bagassa guianensis']","[0.042553191489361, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0]"

Persistent versus cyclic responses to humidity in spider dragline silk,"SUMMARY Spider dragline silk has enormous potential for the development of biomimetic fibers that combine strength and elasticity in low density polymers. These applications necessitate understanding how silk reacts to different environmental conditions. For instance, spider dragline silk `supercontracts' in high humidity. During supercontraction, unrestrained dragline silk contracts up to 50% of its original length and restrained fibers generate substantial stress. Here we characterize the response of dragline silk to changes in humidity before, during and after supercontraction. Our findings demonstrate that dragline silk exhibits two qualitatively different responses to humidity. First, silk undergoes a previously unknown cyclic relaxation–contraction response to wetting and drying. The direction and magnitude of this cyclic response is identical both before and after supercontraction. By contrast, supercontraction is a `permanent' tensioning of restrained silk in response to high humidity. Here, water induces stress, rather than relaxation and the uptake of water molecules results in a permanent change in molecular composition of the silk, as demonstrated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Even after drying, silk mass increased by∼ 1% after supercontraction. By contrast, the cyclic response to humidity involves a reversible uptake of water. Dried, post-supercontraction silk also differs mechanically from virgin silk. Post-supercontraction silk exhibits reduced stiffness and stress at yield, as well as changes in dynamic energy storage and dissipation. In addition to advancing understanding supercontraction, our findings open up new applications for synthetic silk analogs. For example, dragline silk emerges as a model for a biomimetic muscle, the contraction of which is precisely controlled by humidity alone.",0.024115773,0.049783777,0.030408852,0.032787245,0.05150372,0.025875896,0.03949237,0.025689356,0.023499805,0.060868666,0.031601377,0.035449073,0.05216859,0.036221765,0.025170932,0.039881077,0.022984536,0.032423943,0.02237415,0.03523759,0.042268623,0.01815037,0.044989772,0.032518074,0.84317744,0.043628972,0.8566437,0.83691007,0.035349704,[],[],[]

Recent research suggests that bacteria and archaea are involved in every step of the biogeochemical cycle of gold, from the formation of primary mineralization in hydrothermal and deep subsurface systems to its solubilization, dispersion and re-concentration as secondary gold under surface conditions. Enzymatically catalysed precipitation of gold has been observed in thermophilic and hyperthermophilic bacteria and archaea (for example, Thermotoga maritime, Pyrobaculum islandicum), and their activity led to the formation of gold- and silver-bearing sinters in New Zealand's hot spring systems. Sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB), for example, Desulfovibrio sp., may be involved in the formation of gold-bearing sulphide minerals in deep subsurface environments; over geological timescales this may contribute to the formation of economic deposits. Iron- and sulphur-oxidizing bacteria (for example, Acidothiobacillus ferrooxidans, A. thiooxidans) are known to breakdown gold-hosting sulphide minerals in zones of primary mineralization, and release associated gold in the process. These and other bacteria (for example, actinobacteria) produce thiosulphate, which is known to oxidize gold and form stable, transportable complexes. Other microbial processes, for example, excretion of amino acids and cyanide, may control gold solubilization in auriferous top- and rhizosphere soils. A number of bacteria and archaea are capable of actively catalysing the precipitation of toxic gold(I/III) complexes. Reductive precipitation of these complexes may improve survival rates of bacterial populations that are capable of (1) detoxifying the immediate cell environment by detecting, excreting and reducing gold complexes, possibly using P-type ATPase efflux pumps as well as membrane vesicles (for example, Salmonella enterica, Cupriavidus (Ralstonia) metallidurans, Plectonema boryanum); (2) gaining metabolic energy by utilizing gold-complexing ligands (for example, thiosulphate by A. ferrooxidans) or (3) using gold as metal centre in enzymes (Micrococcus luteus). C. metallidurans containing biofilms were detected on gold grains from two Australian sites, indicating that gold bioaccumulation may lead to gold biomineralization by forming secondary ‘bacterioform’ gold. Formation of secondary octahedral gold crystals from gold(III) chloride solution, was promoted by a cyanobacterium (P. boryanum) via an amorphous gold(I) sulphide intermediate. ‘Bacterioform’ gold and secondary gold crystals are common in quartz pebble conglomerates (QPC), where they are often associated with bituminous organic matter possibly derived from cyanobacteria. This may suggest that cyanobacteria have played a role in the formation of the Witwatersrand QPC, the world's largest gold deposit.",0.007144626,0.01275846,0.024816837,0.010555,0.02574857,0.006839715,0.006430555,0.8676015,0.017138481,0.01653749,0.013839966,0.043833066,0.027459737,0.010272242,0.011945201,0.010311137,0.007039115,0.012303312,0.018648386,0.009887532,0.009779132,0.006441996,0.012076236,0.025858134,0.010943875,0.011692083,0.008634593,0.01646992,0.012611712,[],[],[]

These embryos probably experience oxygen deprivation as part of their normal developmental environment. We assessed the anoxia tolerance of A. limnaeus embryos across the duration of embryonic development. Embryos develop a substantial tolerance to anoxia during early development, which peaks during diapause II. This extreme tolerance of anoxia is retained during the first 4 days of post-diapause II development and is then lost. Metabolism during anoxia appears to be supported mainly by production of lactate, with alanine and succinate production contributing to a lesser degree. Anoxic embryos also accumulate large quantities of γ-aminobutyrate (GABA), a potential protector of neural function. It appears that the suite of characters associated with normal development and entry into diapause II in this species prepares the embryos for long-term survival in anoxia even while the embryos are exposed to aerobic conditions. This is the first report of such extreme anoxia tolerance in a vertebrate embryo, and introduces a new model for the study of anoxia tolerance in vertebrates.",0.015480317,0.005349994,0.013320822,0.004006029,0.01641557,0.003919559,0.032892812,0.007434292,0.027374089,0.008145443,0.022435717,0.020062622,0.00826406,0.007208481,0.013251191,0.9084561,0.005101619,0.009943345,0.011866214,0.012867889,0.005759498,0.008076732,0.06930085,0.015862942,0.011265409,0.019491037,0.00800777,0.04428217,0.015586119,"['crayfish', 'ray', 'rays', 'astacus leptodactylus']","[0.020833333333333003, 0.0625, 0.020833333333333003, 0.0]","[0.33333333333333304, 1.0, 0.33333333333333304, 0.0]"

Well known and widespread is the regurgitation of oral secretion (OS), fluid that repels attacking predators. In herbivores, the effectiveness of OS has been ascribed so far to the presence of deterrent secondary metabolites sequestered from the host plant. This notion implies, however, that generalists experience less protection on plants with low amounts of secondary metabolites or with compounds ineffective against potential enemies. Resolving the dilemma, we describe a novel defence mechanism that is independent of deterrents as it relies on the intrinsic detergent properties of the OS. The OS of Spodoptera exigua (and other species) was found to be highly amphiphilic and well capable of wetting the hydrophobic cuticle of predatory ants. As a result, affected ants stopped attacking and engaged in extensive cleansing. The presence of surfactants was sufficient to explain the defensive character of herbivore OS. We hypothesize that detergency is a common but unrecognized mode of defence, which provides a base level of protection that may or may not be further enhanced by plant-derived deterrents. Our study also proves that insects ‘invented’ the use of defensive surfactants long before modern agriculture had started applying them as insecticides.",0.021526193,0.010640397,0.005110181,0.088127315,0.008783923,0.004158339,0.006380874,0.004360123,0.004486048,0.007865919,0.026640207,0.004859744,0.044633787,0.41851327,0.010521389,0.004989321,0.010181468,0.010515543,0.014804243,0.005159665,0.007642937,0.018423334,0.006296507,0.008050834,0.01512126,0.036123596,0.008678062,0.015313212,0.006644577,['plants'],[0.053191489361702],[1.0]

Our data support the hypothesis that floats and rafting evolved via modified epitoniid egg masses rather than by juvenile droguing.

These include aquatic vascular plants, aquatic mosses and some larger algae. The presence or absence of aquatic macrophytes is one of the characteristics used to define wetlands, and as such macrophytes are an indispensable component of these ecosystems. As the most important removal processes in constructed treatment wetlands are based on physical and microbial processes, the role of the macrophytes in these has been questioned. This paper summarizes how macrophytes influence the treatment processes in wetlands.

The most important functions of the macrophytes in relation to the treatment of wastewater are the physical effects the presence of the plants gives rise to. The macrophytes stabilise the surface of the beds, provide good conditions for physical filtration, prevent vertical flow systems from clogging, insulate the surface against frost during winter, and provide a huge surface area for attached microbial growth. Contrary to earlier belief, the growth of macrophytes does not increase the hydraulic conductivity of the substrate in soil-based subsurface flow constructed wetlands. The metabolism of the macrophytes affects the treatment processes to different extents depending on the type of the constructed wetland. Plant uptake of nutrients is only of quantitative importance in low-loaded systems (surface flow systems). Macrophyte mediated transfer of oxygen to the rhizosphere by leakage from roots increases aerobic degradation of organic matter and nitrification. The macrophytes have additional site-specific values by providing habitat for wildlife and making wastewater treatment systems aesthetically pleasing.",0.036483146,0.007391783,0.012692856,0.014809808,0.005715284,0.006704559,0.00399185,0.006266317,0.006242582,0.005136727,0.029183727,0.004599275,0.6395562,0.011362967,0.007709018,0.002866743,0.007740481,0.006999959,0.015248057,0.00755815,0.009694953,0.011755314,0.006301641,0.005816738,0.007239156,0.017615857,0.006329825,0.006975673,0.005234527,['sea urchin'],[0.0],[0]

Through muscular contraction and expansion of their foot, they transmit waves of shear stress through a thin layer of mucus onto a solid substrate. Since a free surface cannot support shear stress, adhesive locomotion is not a viable propulsion mechanism for water snails that travel inverted beneath the free surface. Nevertheless, the motion of the freshwater snail, Sorbeoconcha physidae, is reminiscent of that of its terrestrial counterparts, being generated by the undulation of the snail foot that is separated from the free surface by a thin layer of mucus.

We applied this evolutionary concept to barnacle cement polymerization, a process critical to barnacle fitness that involves aggregation and cross-linking of proteins. The biochemical mechanisms of cement polymerization remain largely unknown. We hypothesized that this process is biochemically similar to blood clotting, a critical physiological response that is also based on aggregation and cross-linking of proteins. Like key elements of vertebrate and invertebrate blood clotting, barnacle cement polymerization was shown to involve proteolytic activation of enzymes and structural precursors, transglutaminase cross-linking and assembly of fibrous proteins. Proteolytic activation of structural proteins maximizes the potential for bonding interactions with other proteins and with the surface. Transglutaminase cross-linking reinforces cement integrity. Remarkably, epitopes and sequences homologous to bovine trypsin and human transglutaminase were identified in barnacle cement with tandem mass spectrometry and/or western blotting. Akin to blood clotting, the peptides generated during proteolytic activation functioned as signal molecules, linking a molecular level event (protein aggregation) to a behavioral response (barnacle larval settlement). Our results draw attention to a highly conserved protein polymerization mechanism and shed light on a long-standing biochemical puzzle. We suggest that barnacle cement polymerization is a specialized form of wound healing. The polymerization mechanism common between barnacle cement and blood may be a theme for many marine animal glues.",0.012479376,0.010916992,0.008236605,0.008183984,0.017262569,0.010453779,0.007604124,0.015647681,0.017831452,0.044280477,0.009053351,0.007361044,0.019393219,0.009367153,0.9020854,0.013581421,0.008080412,0.011465202,0.009655263,0.007946556,0.012692259,0.00625316,0.009539172,0.030835204,0.005754826,0.008910011,0.01592779,0.011595706,0.009723048,[],[],[]

This paper explores how the contractile force generated at the sarcomeres within an individual muscle fiber is transferred through the connective tissue to move the bones. The initial key point for transfer of the contractile force is the muscle cell membrane (sarcolemma) where force is transferred laterally to the basement membrane (specialized extracellular matrix rich in laminins) to be integrated within the connective tissue (rich in collagens) before transmission to the tendons. Connections between (1) key molecules outside the myofiber in the basement membrane to (2) molecules within the sarcolemma of the myofiber and (3) the internal cytoplasmic structures of the cytoskeleton and sarcomeres are evaluated. Disturbances to many components of this complex interactive system adversely affect skeletal muscle strength and integrity, and can result in severe muscle diseases. The mechanical aspects of these crucial linkages are discussed, with particular reference to defects in laminin‐α2 and integrin‐α7. Novel interventions to potentially increase muscle strength and reduce myofiber damage are mentioned, and these are also highly relevant to muscle diseases and aging muscle.",0.057415284,0.03216334,0.10760117,0.03438618,0.88047224,0.68195844,0.72678614,0.07389861,0.056321323,0.084139995,0.037845165,0.025138753,0.04904069,0.07393784,0.6282081,0.071598366,0.8092267,0.03723155,0.04458156,0.0735865,0.09974284,0.04323165,0.068143375,0.73846793,0.09550796,0.056946393,0.11141207,0.024594394,0.64108413,"['butterflies', 'papilio']","[0.04, 0.04]","[1.0, 1.0]"

For interspecific cooperation (mutualism), most approaches to this paradox focus on costs and benefits of individual partners and the strategies mutualists use to associate with beneficial partners. However, natural selection acts on lifetime fitness, and most mutualists, particularly longer-lived species interacting with shorter-lived partners (e.g., corals and zooxanthellae, tropical trees and mycorrhizae) interact with multiple partner species throughout ontogeny. Determining how multiple partnerships might interactively affect lifetime fitness is a crucial unexplored link in understanding the evolution and maintenance of cooperation. The tropical tree Acacia drepanolobium associates with four symbiotic ant species whose short-term individual effects range from mutualistic to parasitic. Using a long-term dataset, we show that tree fitness is enhanced by partnering sequentially with sets of different ant symbionts over the ontogeny of a tree. These sets include a “sterilization parasite” that prevents reproduction and another that reduces tree survivorship. Trees associating with partner sets that include these “parasites” enhance lifetime fitness by trading off survivorship and fecundity at different life stages. Our results demonstrate the importance of evaluating mutualism within a community context and suggest that lifespan inequalities among mutualists may help cooperation persist in the face of exploitation.",0.022584174,0.004845764,0.010924785,0.109108955,0.006720433,0.003975926,0.003699315,0.004726935,0.003649155,0.0332161,0.01001375,0.0331052,0.007269417,0.041989658,0.007960462,0.003090188,0.004962327,0.005611789,0.015546232,0.004528462,0.003308775,0.22196409,0.004088916,0.020138398,0.005283591,0.011568728,0.004031597,0.005741257,0.004845918,['plants'],[0.022727272727272003],[1.0]

We show here that it can be described on the basis of four biomechanical traits, two safety traits against winds and self-buckling, and two motricity traits involved in sustaining an upright position, tropic motion velocity (MV) and posture control (PC). All these traits are integrated at the tree scale, combining tree size and shape together with wood properties. The assumption of trait constancy has been used to derive allometric scaling laws, but it was more recently found that observing their variations among environments and functional groups, or during ontogeny, provides more insights into adaptive syndromes of tree shape and wood properties. However, oversimplified expressions have often been used, possibly concealing key adaptive drivers. An extreme case of oversimplification is the use of wood basic density as a proxy for safety. Actually, as wood density is involved in stiffness, loads, and construction costs, the impact of its variations on safety is non-trivial. Moreover, other wood features, especially the microfibril angle (MFA), are also involved. Furthermore, wood is not only stiff and strong, but it also acts as a motor for MV and PC. The relevant wood trait for this is maturation strain asymmetry. Maturation strains vary with cell-wall characteristics such as MFA, rather than with wood density. Finally, the need for further studies about the ecological relevance of branching patterns, motricity traits, and growth responses to mechanical loads is discussed.",0.007050894,0.003312081,0.013775728,0.002710535,0.868819,0.00422177,0.020891316,0.018596152,0.015226633,0.009197973,0.007748821,0.003887535,0.0048417,0.004407807,0.006791505,0.009075543,0.005387858,0.0053499,0.008269337,0.003306655,0.016918473,0.003470849,0.007277587,0.006483522,0.017629493,0.009401405,0.015832443,0.006519534,0.006485689,"['neochlamisus', 'lynx spiders', 'beetles', 'crickets', 'spiders', 'leaf beetles', 'bugs']","[0.011494252873563001, 0.0, 0.011494252873563001, 0.011494252873563001, 0.011494252873563001, 0.011494252873563001, 0.011494252873563001]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]"

The performance of this morphology in relation to fog interception has not been studied. Some first-principles from physics predict that narrow leaves, together with other ancillary traits (large number and high flexibility of leaves, caudices, and/or epiphytism) which constitute the “narrow-leaf syndrome” should increase fog-interception efficiency. This was tested using aluminum models of rosettes that differed in leaf length, width and number and were exposed to artificial fog. The results were validated using seven species of Tillandsia and four species of xerophytic rosettes. The total amount of fog intercepted in rosette plants increased with total leaf area, while narrow leaves maximized interception efficiency (measured as interception per unit area). The number of leaves in the rosettes is physically constrained because wide-leafed plants can only have a few blades. At the limits of this constraint, net fog interception was independent of leaf form, but interception efficiency was maximized by large numbers of narrow leaves. Atmospheric Tillandsia species show the narrow-leaf syndrome. Their fog interception efficiencies were correlated to the ones predicted from aluminum-model data. In the larger xerophytic rosette species, the interception efficiency was greatest in plants showing the narrow-leaf syndrome. The adaptation to fog-harvesting in several narrow-leaved rosettes was tested for evolutionary convergence in 30 xerophytic rosette species using a comparative method. There was a significant evolutionary tendency towards the development of the narrow-leaf syndrome the closer the species grew to areas where fog is frequently available. This study establishes convergence in a very wide group of plants encompassing genera as contrasting as Tillandsia and Agave as a result of their dependence on fog.",0.45061052,0.016354505,0.008140494,0.010901967,0.002476961,0.006070027,0.002787649,0.004338121,0.003809339,0.011358854,0.008179148,0.004753014,0.010009101,0.012823822,0.006521415,0.002587037,0.00383615,0.013347994,0.05896309,0.008501932,0.009731885,0.005828096,0.011568951,0.003131079,0.003944024,0.003222321,0.004622235,0.013683537,0.005485007,[],[],[]

In the European Wadden Sea, this trophic guild includes decapod crustaceans and fish when the tide is in, while during nocturnal low tides the polychaete Phyllodoce mucosa is attracted in large numbers by dead mollusks, crabs or worms on the sediment surface. Within 10 s worms emerged to the surface, crawled as far as 15 m on mucus trails towards the carcass, sucked in tissue up to one-third of their own weight, and then quickly retreated to below the surface. Abundance of P. mucosa was highest in the lower intertidal zone and winter. The seaward high abundance pattern, however, did not continue into the shallow subtidal. In summer, few were attracted during daytime or when the tide was in. However, up to 447 worms aggregated at a single crushed mussel within 20 min at dusk during low-tide exposure. This study suggests that during winter carrion-feeding is an important trophic niche on cold-temperate, intertidal mud flats occupied by a phyllodocid polychaete that is segregated in feeding time from most other scavengers and benefits from cold-sensitive benthic invertebrates.",0.012079712,0.00680523,0.011183176,0.008723639,0.02821768,0.013767619,0.028698836,0.007366474,0.014356632,0.007184661,0.017665956,0.009973579,0.021665674,0.006360032,0.017065037,0.00425757,0.02051312,0.014938748,0.016578153,0.008716323,0.8591315,0.006456601,0.025200438,0.009384975,0.012555865,0.009814571,0.012633767,0.011567828,0.024214787,['bacteria'],[0.025],[1.0]

They had been described by Schulze and represent the phylogenetically oldest class of siliceous sponges (phylum Porifera); they are eye-catching because of their distinct body plan, which relies on a filigree skeleton. It is constructed by an array of morphologically determined elements, the spicules. Soon after, during the German Deep Sea Expedition ""Valdivia"" (1898-1899), Schulze could describe the largest siliceous hexactinellid sponge on Earth, the up to 3-m high Monorhaphis chuni, which develops the equally largest bio-silica structure, the giant basal spicules (3 mx10 mm). Using these spicules as a model, basic knowledge on the morphology, formation, and development of the skeletal elements could be achieved. They are formed by a proteinaceous scaffold (composed of a 27-kDa protein), which mediates the formation of the siliceous lamellae, into which the proteins are encased. The high number of 800 of 5-10 microm thick lamellae is concentrically arranged around the axial canal. The silica matrix is composed of almost pure silicon oxide, providing it with unusually optophysical properties, which are superior to those of man-made waveguides. Experiments might suggest that the spicules function in vivo as a nonocular photoreception system. In addition, the spicules have exceptional mechanical properties, combining mechanical stability with strength and stiffness. Like demosponges, also the hexactinellids synthesize their silica enzymatically, via the enzyme silicatein (27-kDa protein).

The process begins with the condensation of a water droplet at the base of the spore. The fusion of the droplet onto the spore creates a momentum that propels the spore forward. The use of surface tension for spore ejection offers a new paradigm to perform work at small length scales. However, this mechanism of force generation remains poorly understood. To elucidate how fungal spores make effective use of surface tension, we performed a detailed mechanical analysis of the three stages of spore ejection: the transfer of energy from the drop to the spore, the work of fracture required to release the spore from its supporting structure and the kinetic energy of the spore after ejection. High-speed video imaging of spore ejection in Auricularia auricula and Sporobolomyces yeasts revealed that drop coalescence takes place over a short distance (∼5 μm) and energy transfer is completed in less than 4 μs. Based on these observations, we developed an explicit relation for the conversion of surface energy into kinetic energy during the coalescence process. The relation was validated with a simple artificial system and shown to predict the initial spore velocity accurately (predicted velocity: 1.2 m s–1; observed velocity: 0.8 m s–1 for A. auricula). Using calibrated microcantilevers, we also demonstrate that the work required to detach the spore from the supporting sterigma represents only a small fraction of the total energy available for spore ejection. Finally, our observations of this unique discharge mechanism reveal a surprising similarity with the mechanics of jumping in animals.",0.031912405,0.008587621,0.012965321,0.008278571,0.01870367,0.007183292,0.00612902,0.020359175,0.015724294,0.02083568,0.0183061,0.026069105,0.014701203,0.018633531,0.010854166,0.012707666,0.013649124,0.016200341,0.8633883,0.00864916,0.021189246,0.013229898,0.02246956,0.009359502,0.010693495,0.016433649,0.008553036,0.014496609,0.008310617,"['summit rat', 'mountain treeshrew', 'rat', 'tupaia', 'tupaia montana', 'montana', 'arthropods']","[0.013157894736842, 0.013157894736842, 0.052631578947368, 0.013157894736842, 0.013157894736842, 0.026315789473684, 0.013157894736842]","[0.25, 0.25, 1.0, 0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0.25]"

The 60+ Myr fossil record of penguins spans an interval that witnessed dramatic shifts in Cenozoic ocean temperatures and currents, indicating a long interplay between penguin evolution and environmental change. Perhaps the most celebrated example is the successful Late Cenozoic invasion of glacial environments by crown clade penguins. A major adaptation that allows penguins to forage in cold water is the humeral arterial plexus, a vascular counter-current heat exchanger (CCHE) that limits heat loss through the flipper. Fossil evidence reveals that the humeral plexus arose at least 49 Ma during a ‘Greenhouse Earth’ interval. The evolution of the CCHE is therefore unrelated to global cooling or development of polar ice sheets, but probably represents an adaptation to foraging in subsurface waters at temperate latitudes.

We have explored the functional consequences of flat, narrow vs. wide, undulate blade morphologies in the giant bull kelpNereocystis luetkeana. Our study focused on the behavior of blades in ambient water currents and the consequences of that behavior to breakage and to photosynthesis. In flowing water, the narrow, flat blades flap with lower amplitude and collapse together into a more streamlined bundle than do wide, undulate blades, and hence experience lower drag per blade area at a given flow velocity. If the algae at current-swept sites had ruffled blades, drag forces would sometimes be sufficient to break the stipes. However, flat blades in a streamlined bundle experience more self-shading than do undulate blades, which remain spread out in water currents. Thus, there is a morphological trade-off between reducing drag and reducing self-shading. Photosynthetic14C-HCO3 uptake rates decrease in slow flow when the boundary layer along the blade surface across which diffusion takes place is relatively thick.

Our results highlight the need for more collaboration and discussion between micro- and macroscale biologists working on global issues in the Southern Ocean. Tritrophic mutualistic interactions have been best studied in plant–insect systems. During these interactions, plants release volatiles in response to herbivore damage, which, in turn, facilitates predation on primary consumers or benefits the primary producer by providing nutrients. Here we explore a similar interaction in the Southern Ocean food web, where soluble iron limits primary productivity. Dimethyl sulfide has been studied in the context of global climate regulation and is an established foraging cue for marine top predators.

We evaluated an intriguing structure whose function has never been thoroughly tested. Specifically, we evaluated the hypothesis that the body-enclosing ‘faecal case’ created and lived in by the immature stages of Neochlamisus leaf beetles reduces their risk of predation. We especially focus on the case of N. platani, which is externally covered with host-plant trichomes, and includes a distinct trichome-filled chamber (‘attic’) in the case apex. Here, we separately evaluated the effects of case, trichomes and attic on each of several behavioural stages of predator attack using N. platani and N. bimaculatus larvae and pupae. Three generalist predators (crickets, soldier bugs and lynx spiders) that represent different feeding strategies were used in our individual-level repeated observation behavioural trials. Results strongly demonstrated that the faecal case itself greatly reduced predation risk for all combinations of beetle species, life history stage and predator. Additional evidence indicated that both trichomes and attics further and independently reduced predation risk. Variation in results among treatments was also informative. For example, the capacity of faecal case components to reduce predation sometimes varied markedly among predators and between larval versus pupal life stages. Patterns of predator behaviour provided no evidence that caseless larvae have alternative means of defence.

Experimental manipulations of protective ant-plant associations typically last for less than a year, yet virtually all specialized myrmecophytes are long-lived perennials for which the costs and benefits of maintaining ant symbionts could accrue at different rates over the host's lifetime. To complement long-term monitoring studies, we experimentally excluded each of four ant symbionts from their long-lived myrmecophyte host trees (Acacia drepanolobium) for 4.5 years. Ant species varied in their effectiveness against herbivores and in their effects on intermediate-term growth and reproduction, but the level of herbivore protection provided was a poor predictor of the net impact they had on host trees. Removal of the three Crematogaster species resulted in cumulative gains in host tree growth and/or reproduction over the course of the experiment, despite the fact that two of those species significantly reduce chronic herbivore damage. In contrast, although T. penzigi is a relatively poor defender, the low cost of maintaining this ant symbiont apparently eliminated negative impacts on overall tree growth and reproduction, resulting in enhanced allocation to new branch growth by the final census. Acacia drepanolobium is evidently highly tolerant of herbivory by insects and small browsers, and the costs of maintaining Crematogaster colonies exceeded the benefits received during the study. No experimental trees were killed by elephants, but elephant damage was uniquely associated with reduced tree growth, and at least one ant species (C. mimosae) strongly deterred elephant browsing.

Herein we show that the natural quill’s geometry enables easy penetration and high tissue adhesion where the barbs specifically contribute to adhesion and unexpectedly, dramatically reduce the force required to penetrate tissue. Reduced penetration force is achieved by topography that appears to create stress concentrations along regions of the quill where the cross sectional diameter grows rapidly, facilitating cutting of the tissue. Barbs located near the first geometrical transition zone exhibit the most substantial impact on minimizing the force required for penetration. Barbs at the tip of the quill independently exhibit the greatest impact on tissue adhesion force and the cooperation between barbs in the 0–2 mm and 2–4 mm regions appears critical to enhance tissue adhesion force. The dual functions of barbs were reproduced with replica molded synthetic polyurethane quills.

Biofilms are often extremely tolerant to antimicrobials but their reliance on shared EPS may also be a weakness as social evolution theory predicts that inhibiting shared traits can select against resistance. Here we show that EPS of Salmonella biofilms is a cooperative trait whose benefit is shared among cells, and that EPS inhibition reduces both cell attachment and antimicrobial tolerance. We then compare an EPS inhibitor to conventional antimicrobials in an evolutionary experiment. While resistance against conventional antimicrobials rapidly evolves, we see no evolution of resistance to EPS inhibition. We further show that a resistant strain is outcompeted by a susceptible strain under EPS inhibitor treatment, explaining why resistance does not evolve.

The degree of stem coverage is species-specific. The suggestion that persistent dead leaves have an insulatory function and are adaptive in fire-prone habitat was tested on Aloe ferox. Field surveys demonstrated a significant negative relationship between mortality and degree of stem coverage and laboratory studies confirmed the insulating properties of dead leaves. The distribution of southern African tree aloes supprts the prediction that bare-stemmed species would be confined to fire-free habitat whilst fully clothed species would occur in both fire-prone and fire-free habitat. The study suggests that harvesting of Aloe ferox leaves for medicinal purposes could result in significant mortality in fires.,0.003357542,0.001777049,0.004075215,0.002298526,0.011252935,0.001961069,0.004113309,0.002982284,0.014226531,0.003368629,0.008790352,0.003845095,0.006198437,0.003356253,0.009820397,0.008710664,0.002106941,0.003569208,0.00736058,0.003123222,0.005976595,0.002960886,0.002527405,0.01780987,0.003825812,0.045601424,0.006079957,0.015536916,0.002066698,"['coprinellus radians', 'basidiomycetes']","[0.0, 0.014925373134328]","[0.0, 1.0]"

In particular, the labiomaxillary complex is essential for food intake. In the present study we investigated the anatomical design of the labiomaxillary complex in various ant species, focusing on movement mechanisms. Six labial and six maxillary muscles with different functions control the several joints and ensure the proper performance of the labiomaxillary complex. According to our measurements of sarcomere lengths, muscle fiber lengths and diameters, and the relative muscle volumes, the labial and maxillary muscles feature rather slow than fast muscle characteristics and do not seem to be specialized for specific tasks. Since glossa protractor muscles are absent, the protraction of the glossa, the distal end of the labium, is a nonmuscular movement. By histological measurements of hemolymph volumes we could exclude a pressure‐driven mechanism. Additional experiments showed that, upon relaxation of the glossa retractor muscles, the glossa protracts elastically. This elastic mechanism possibly sets an upper limit to licking frequency, thus influencing food intake rates and ultimately foraging behavior. In contrast to many other elastic mechanisms among arthropods, glossa protraction in ants is based on a mechanism where elasticity works as an actual antagonist to muscles. We compared the design of the labiomaxillary complex of ants with that of the honeybee and suggest an elastic mechanism for glossa protraction in honeybees as well. J.

The amounts of palmitic and oleic acids were constant during the light-dark cycle and under continuous light, but those of linoleic and linolenic acids fluctuated, attaining a high level in the middle of the dark period or the subjective night, and a low level in the middle of the light period or the subjective day. A low temperature of 20[deg]C induced CR and affected changes in fatty acid composition similar to those that occurred during the daily CR phase.

A number of Bornean Nepenthes demonstrate novel nutrient acquisition strategies. Notably, three giant montane species are engaged in a mutualistic association with the mountain treeshrew, Tupaia montana, in which the treeshrew defecates into the pitchers while visiting them to feed on nectar secretions on the pitchers' lids. Although the basis of this resource mutualism has been elucidated, many aspects are yet to be investigated. We sought to provide insights into the value of the mutualism to each participant. During initial observations we discovered that the summit rat, R. baluensis, also feeds on sugary exudates of N. rajah pitchers and defecates into them, and that this behavior appears to be habitual. The scope of the study was therefore expanded to assess to what degree N. rajah interacts with the small mammal community. We found that both T. montana and R. baluensis are engaged in a mutualistic interaction with N. rajah. T .montana visit pitchers more frequently than R. baluensis, but daily scat deposition rates within pitchers do not differ, suggesting that the mutualistic relationships are of a similar strength. This study is the first to demonstrate that a mutualism exists between a carnivorous plant species and multiple members of a small mammal community. Further, the newly discovered mutualism between R. baluensis and N. rajah represents only the second ever example of a multidirectional resource-based mutualism between a mammal and a carnivorous plant.",0.14969808,0.00296586,0.004849654,0.009925237,0.006989388,0.003338263,0.002434503,0.014840689,0.004077292,0.005658634,0.017882792,0.014568285,0.012077306,0.010680896,0.005541082,0.003648888,0.002282027,0.005138655,0.07781351,0.003341863,0.007349715,0.003773229,0.004244341,0.004989558,0.004304341,0.006950315,0.003172629,0.006292711,0.004393469,['fish'],[0.022222222222222],[1.0]

Their death releases these biominerals into the environment, which subsequently transform to calcite via a monohydrocalcite intermediate. Here, the fate of Ca-oxalates released by plants in arid environments is investigated. This novel and widespread form of biomineralization has unexpected consequences on C cycling and calcite accumulation in areas with large numbers of cacti. The magnitude of this mineralization is revealed by studying the large columnar cactus Carnegiea gigantea (Engelm.) Britton and Rose in southwestern Arizona (locally called the saguaro). A large C. gigantea contains on the order of 1×105 g of the Ca-oxalate weddellite—CaC2O4·2H2O. In areas with high C. gigantea density, there is an estimated 40 g Catm m−2 sequestered in Ca-oxalates. Following the death of the plant, the weddellite transforms to calcite on the order to 10–20 years. In areas with high saguaro density, there is an estimated release of up to 2.4 g calcite m−2 year−1 onto the desert soil. Similar transformation mechanisms occur with the Ca-oxalates that are abundant in the majority of cacti. Thus, the total atmospheric C returned to the soil of areas with a high number density of cacti is large, suggesting that there may be a significant long-term accumulation of atmospheric C in these soils derived from Ca-oxalate biominerals.

Here we investigate quasi-ordered nanostructures of avian feather barbs which produce vivid non-iridescent colors. These β-keratin and air nanostructures are found in two basic morphologies: tortuous channels and amorphous packings of spheres. Each class of nanostructure is isotropic and has a pronounced characteristic length scale of variation in composition. These local structural correlations lead to strong backscattering over a narrow range of optical frequencies and little variation with angle of incidence. Such optical properties play important roles in social and sexual communication. To be effective, birds need to precisely control the development of these nanoscale structures, yet little is known about how they grow. We hypothesize that multiple lineages of birds have convergently evolved to exploit phase separation and kinetic arrest to self-assemble spongy color-producing nanostructures in feather barbs. Observed avian nanostructures are strikingly similar to those self-assembled during the phase separation of fluid mixtures; the channel and sphere morphologies are characteristic of phase separation by spinodal decomposition and nucleation and growth, respectively. These unstable structures are locked-in by the kinetic arrest of the β-keratin matrix, likely through the entanglement or cross-linking of supermolecular β-keratin fibers. Using the power of self-assembly, birds can robustly realize a diverse range of nanoscopic morphologies with relatively small physical and chemical changes during feather development.",0.008559436,0.004612168,0.035185885,0.005424913,0.01131696,0.011803361,0.005930903,0.02501326,0.012125995,0.01171685,0.011714398,0.018384658,0.00677061,0.006538354,0.028936576,0.012755141,0.005585588,0.009084612,0.004452386,0.010369174,0.006592831,0.009982378,0.008589903,0.8422091,0.013721196,0.006613642,0.00502891,0.009271596,0.009377615,"['plants', 'arabidopsis thaliana']","[0.037735849056603, 0.018867924528301]","[1.0, 0.5]"

In this model, based on the work of physicists Douady and Couder, fixed points are the spiral or helical lattices often occurring in plants. The frequent occurrence of the Fibonacci sequence in the number of visible spirals is explained by the stability of the fixed points in this system, as well as by the structure of their bifurcation diagram. We provide a detailed study of this diagram.

During drying of the chlorolichen Cladonia rangiformis and the cyanolichen Peltigera neckeri, chlorophyll fluorescence decreased and stable light-dependent charge separation in reaction centers of the photosynthetic apparatus was lost. The presence of light during desiccation increased loss of fluorescence in the chlorolichen more than that in the cyanolichen. Heating of desiccated Cladonia thalli, but not of Peltigera thalli, increased fluorescence emission more after the lichen had been dried in the light than after drying in darkness. Activation of zeaxanthin-dependent energy dissipation by protonation of the PsbS protein of thylakoid membranes was not responsible for the increased loss of chlorophyll fluorescence by the chlorolichen during drying in the light. Glutaraldehyde inhibited loss of chlorophyll fluorescence during drying. Desiccation-induced loss of chlorophyll fluorescence and of light-dependent charge separation are interpreted to indicate activation of a highly effective mechanism of photoprotection in the lichens. Activation is based on desiccation-induced conformational changes of a pigment–protein complex. Absorbed light energy is converted into heat within a picosecond or femtosecond time domain. When present during desiccation, light interacts with the structural changes of the protein providing increased photoprotection. Energy dissipation is inactivated and structural changes are reversed when water becomes available again. Reversibility of ultra-fast thermal dissipation of light energy avoids photo-damage in the absence of water and facilitates the use of light for photosynthesis almost as soon as water becomes available.",0.016964288,0.015924718,0.018135862,0.005631534,0.016841251,0.013151493,0.030220533,0.012278884,0.023264527,0.010539096,0.08533196,0.013994438,0.012485255,0.011523386,0.015489149,0.8488417,0.012339865,0.01423417,0.018797914,0.028553164,0.012933944,0.013044785,0.9464736,0.011919902,0.018629747,0.01908675,0.012978435,0.048936017,0.031420283,[],[],[]

The N-terminal tryptophan-rich domain of Pvfp-1 contains 42 decapeptide repeats with the consensus sequences ATPKPW1TAW2K and APPPAW1TAW2K. A small collagen domain (18 Gly-X-Y repeats) is also present.

A. aegerita oxidized DBT (110 μM) by 100% within 16 days into eight different metabolites. Among the latter were mainly S-oxidation products (DBT sulfoxide, DBT sulfone) and in lower amounts, ring-hydroxylation compounds (e.g., 2-hydroxy-DBT). C. radians converted about 60% of DBT into DBT sulfoxide and DBT sulfone as the sole metabolites. In vitro tests with purified peroxygenases were performed to compare the product pattern with the metabolites formed in vivo. Using ascorbic acid as radical scavenger, a total of 19 and seven oxygenation products were detected after DBT conversion by the peroxygenases of A. aegerita (AaP) and C. radians (CrP), respectively. Whereas ring hydroxylation was favored over S-oxidation by AaP (again 2-hydroxy-DBT was identified), CrP formed DBT sulfoxide as major product. This finding suggests that fungal peroxygenases can considerably differ in their catalytic properties. Using H218O2, the origin of oxygen was proved to be the peroxide.

During a tandem run, a single leader teaches one follower the route to important resources such as sources of food or better nest sites. In the present study, we investigate what tandem leaders and followers do, in the context of nest emigration, if their partner goes missing. Our experiments involved removing either leaders or followers at set points during tandem runs. Former leaders first stand still and wait for their missing follower but then most often proceed alone to the new nest site. By contrast, former followers often first engage in a Brownian search, for almost exactly the time that their former leader should have waited for them, and then former followers switch to a superdiffusive search. In this way, former followers first search their immediate neighbourhood for their lost leader before becoming ever more wide ranging so that in the absence of their former leader they can often find the new nest, re-encounter the old one or meet a new leader. We also show that followers gain useful information even from incomplete tandem runs. These observations point to the important principle that sophisticated communication behaviours may have evolved as anytime algorithms, i.e. procedures that are beneficial even if they do not run to completion.",0.011985868,0.011430198,0.012720097,0.0392629,0.007674672,0.010236174,0.008155439,0.007309861,0.018234214,0.01911239,0.011249757,0.022762053,0.012410032,0.011623047,0.006216551,0.013760674,0.020098183,0.014011483,0.013809267,0.012310547,0.007460784,0.898048,0.01721047,0.011169191,0.00767347,0.018110147,0.007727004,0.007195014,0.010282598,"['plants', 'higher plants']","[0.055555555555555004, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0]"

In a similar turbulent wake and at roughly the same distance behind a bluff cylinder, a passively mounted high-aspect-ratio foil is also shown to propel itself upstream employing a similar flow energy extraction mechanism.

In this study we tested the ‘enhanced binocular field’ hypothesis (that proposes enhanced frontal binocularity) by comparison of the visual fields of three hammerhead species: the bonnethead shark, Sphyrna tiburo, the scalloped hammerhead shark, Sphyrna lewini, and the winghead shark, Eusphyra blochii, with that of two carcharhinid species: the lemon shark, Negaprion brevirostris, and the blacknose shark, Carcharhinus acronotus. Additionally, eye rotation and head yaw were quantified to determine if species compensate for large blind areas anterior to the head. The winghead shark possessed the largest anterior binocular overlap (48 deg.) and was nearly four times larger than that of the lemon (10 deg.) and blacknose (11 deg.) sharks. The binocular overlap in the scalloped hammerhead sharks (34 deg.) was greater than the bonnethead sharks (13 deg.) and carcharhinid species; however, the bonnethead shark did not differ from the carcharhinids. These results indicate that binocular overlap has increased with lateral head expansion in hammerhead sharks. The hammerhead species did not demonstrate greater eye rotation in the anterior or posterior direction. However, both the scalloped hammerhead and bonnethead sharks exhibited greater head yaw during swimming (16.9 deg. and 15.6 deg., respectively) than the lemon (15.1 deg.) and blacknose (15.0 deg.) sharks, indicating a behavioral compensation for the anterior blind area. This study illustrates the larger binocular overlap in hammerhead species relative to their carcharhinid sister taxa and is consistent with the ‘enhanced binocular field’ hypothesis.",0.015549254,0.8618767,0.013572386,0.015273395,0.008925238,0.012748513,0.009298194,0.012295764,0.008984554,0.008553764,0.005289228,0.007332244,0.010074752,0.010220166,0.008703811,0.004996094,0.007750017,0.01352826,0.008317634,0.010960016,0.008150846,0.014561702,0.025470141,0.008045051,0.009987294,0.012887978,0.011314501,0.008359138,0.012187053,"['pine', 'jack pine']","[0.014925373134328, 0.014925373134328]","[1.0, 1.0]"

They fed on nekton, mainly fish and shrimps, varying in length between 2-21 cm that were caught by sweeping the bill in the water. The feeding behavior of a spoonbill is a chain of feeding and inter-feeding bouts. Each feeding bout started by putting the bill into the water and ended when the bill was taken out and any prey captured was swallowed. The times between feeding bouts were short and no or few steps were made. In a complete feeding bout, up to three functional phases were distinguished. These were successively (1) the attempt to locate a prey, (2) the attempt to catch the located prey, (3) the handling and swallowing of the prey. A feeding bout could end in any phase. A total of 1,684 feeding bouts were recorded of which 65% ended with swallowing prey. The mean outcome was 45.4 small (<5 cm long) and 1.3 large (>5 cm long) prey per 10 min. Tentative measurements indicated that a feeding spoonbill walked on average 3.87 m per 10 s, during which time the bill made 15.7 sweeps with a bill velocity of 5.8 km.h-1, meanwhile testing about 17% of the area within reach of their bill for the presence of food. Feeding by Black-faced Spoonbills often looked chaotic because they usually walk all over the feeding site at a variable speed, while showing a large variety of actions especially when large prey is present. However, analyses of the observations show that they behave efficiently and reduce time and energy spent in feeding in several ways, including giving-up times not much longer than the duration of bouts with success, pursuing only large prey, ceasing feeding and starting to rest or going to another site when no prey is caught in 5-10 min. With their tactile way of feeding on invisible prey, they also behaved efficiently by consuming all detected prey that could be caught and swallowed.",0.88641864,0.028978778,0.053532064,0.031612765,0.018681983,0.8136878,0.01951214,0.014223268,0.03456761,0.0576253,0.039814845,0.027084822,0.03602497,0.042942833,0.020602213,0.025553908,0.035144046,0.042639762,0.039866336,0.8894052,0.02814655,0.017875766,0.05325881,0.036044937,0.04139101,0.025184566,0.019234259,0.04153651,0.044810824,"['mytilus edulis', 'diatoms', 'triakidae', 'sharks']","[0.022727272727272003, 0.034090909090909005, 0.011363636363636001, 0.045454545454545005]","[0.5, 0.7499999999999991, 0.25, 1.0]"

Although salps are centimeters in length, feeding via particle capture occurs on a fine, mucous mesh (fiber diameter d ∼0.1 μm) at low velocity (U = 1.6 ± 0.6 cm·s−1, mean ± SD) and is thus a low Reynolds-number (Re ∼10−3) process. In contrast to the current view that particle encounter is dictated by simple sieving of particles larger than the mesh spacing, a low-Re mathematical model of encounter rates by the salp feeding apparatus for realistic oceanic particle-size distributions shows that submicron particles, due to their higher abundances, are encountered at higher rates (particles per time) than larger particles. Data from feeding experiments with 0.5-, 1-, and 3-μm diameter polystyrene spheres corroborate these findings. Although particles larger than 1 μm (e.g., flagellates, small diatoms) represent a larger carbon pool, smaller particles in the 0.1- to 1-μm range (e.g., bacteria, Prochlorococcus) may be more quickly digestible because they present more surface area, and we find that particles smaller than the mesh size (1.4 μm) can fully satisfy salp energetic needs. Furthermore, by packaging submicrometer particles into rapidly sinking fecal pellets, pelagic tunicates can substantially change particle-size spectra and increase downward fluxes in the ocean.",0.09420022,0.005294065,0.015930526,0.005783267,0.003725528,0.006634457,0.002614653,0.00993899,0.018616587,0.022639817,0.015229866,0.031795822,0.011507911,0.004320268,0.009656613,0.00595134,0.004038601,0.006084096,0.28685135,0.011190751,0.018026602,0.004357023,0.005616725,0.007130767,0.003472857,0.010964287,0.004024374,0.03908529,0.00447727,"['poecile atricapillus', 'black-capped chickadee', 'sitta canadensis', 'red-breasted nuthatch']","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]","[0, 0, 0, 0]"

Emphasis is on recent microbiological advances. The driving force for research on this process continues to be the fact that microbial communities intercept and consume methane from anoxic environments, methane that would otherwise enter the atmosphere. Anaerobic methane oxidation is biogeochemically important because methane is a potent greenhouse gas in the atmosphere and is abundant in anoxic environments. Geochemical evidence for this process has been observed in numerous marine sediments along the continental margins, in methane seeps and vents, around methane hydrate deposits, and in anoxic waters. The anaerobic oxidation of methane is performed by at least two phylogenetically distinct groups of archaea, the ANME-1 and ANME-2. These archaea are frequently observed as consortia with sulfate-reducing bacteria, and the metabolism of these consortia presumably involves a syntrophic association based on interspecies electron transfer. The archaeal member of a consortium apparently oxidizes methane and shuttles reduced compounds to the sulfate-reducing bacteria. Despite recent advances in understanding anaerobic methane oxidation, uncertainties still remain regarding the nature and necessity of the syntrophic association, the biochemical pathway of methane oxidation, and the interaction of the process with the local chemical and physical environment.

Nanocellulose may prove to be one of the most promising green materials of modern times due to its intrinsic properties, renewability, and abundance. In this review, we present nanocellulose-based materials from sourcing, synthesis, and surface modification of nanocellulose, to materials formation and applications. Nanocellulose can be sourced from biomass, plants, or bacteria, relying on fairly simple, scalable, and efficient isolation techniques. Mechanical, chemical, and enzymatic treatments, or a combination of these, can be used to extract nanocellulose from natural sources. The properties of nanocellulose are dependent on the source, the isolation technique, and potential subsequent surface transformations. Nanocellulose surface modification techniques are typically used to introduce either charged or hydrophobic moieties, and include amidation, esterification, etherification, silylation, polymerization, urethanization, sulfonation, and phosphorylation. Nanocellulose has excellent strength, high Young's modulus, biocompatibility, and tunable self-assembly, thixotropic, and photonic properties, which are essential for the applications of this material. Nanocellulose participates in the fabrication of a large range of nanomaterials and nanocomposites, including those based on polymers, metals, metal oxides, and carbon. In particular, nanocellulose complements organic-based materials, where it imparts its mechanical properties to the composite. Nanocellulose is a promising material whenever material strength, flexibility, and/or specific nanostructuration are required. Applications include functional paper, optoelectronics, and antibacterial coatings, packaging, mechanically reinforced polymer composites, tissue scaffolds, drug delivery, biosensors, energy storage, catalysis, environmental remediation, and electrochemically controlled separation. Phosphorylated nanocellulose is a particularly interesting material, spanning a surprising set of applications in various dimensions including bone scaffolds, adsorbents, and flame retardants and as a support for the heterogenization of homogeneous catalysts.",0.007232801,0.003334168,0.010805689,0.002760976,0.8765316,0.00594558,0.018458748,0.018069802,0.014767109,0.009358529,0.006333037,0.004019986,0.005248646,0.005115503,0.007819747,0.009742888,0.005891105,0.006386206,0.008048199,0.003423826,0.015828356,0.004596834,0.010284349,0.006085246,0.014187411,0.012275288,0.015702507,0.00811576,0.007946651,[],[],[]

Complementation studies have shown that class I hydrophobins belong to a closely related group of morphogenetic proteins, but that they have evolved to function at specific interfaces.

We investigated the relation between cell wall structure and the resulting mechanical characteristics of different plant tissues. Special attention was paid to the mechanical behaviour beyond the linear-elastic range, the underlying micromechanical processes and the fracture characteristics. The previously proposed model of reorientation and slippage of the cellulose microfibrils in the cell wall [H.-CH. Spatz et al. (1999) J Exp Biol 202:3269–3272) was supported and is here refined, using measurements of the changes in microfibrillar angle during straining. Our model explains the widespread phenomenon of stress-strain curves with two linear portions of different slope and sheds light on the micromechanical processes involved in viscoelasticity and plastic yield. We also analysed the velocity dependence of viscoelasticity under the perspective of the Kelvin model, resolving the measured viscoelasticity into functions of a velocity-dependent and a velocity-independent friction. The influence of lignin on the above-mentioned mechanical properties was examined by chemical lignin extraction from tissues of Aristolochia macrophylla Lam. and by the use of transgenic plants of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.)

Species inhabiting lotic regimes often adapt to these conditions by evolving low‐drag (i.e., streamlined) morphologies that reduce the likelihood of dislodgment or displacement. However, hydrodynamic factors are not the only selective pressures influencing organismal morphology and shapes well suited to flow conditions may compromise performance in other roles. We investigated the possibility of morphological trade‐offs in the turtle Pseudemys concinna. Individuals living in lotic environments have flatter, more streamlined shells than those living in lentic environments; however, this flatter shape may also make the shells less capable of resisting predator‐induced loads. We tested the idea that “lotic” shell shapes are weaker than “lentic” shell shapes, concomitantly examining effects of sex. Geometric morphometric data were used to transform an existing finite element shell model into a series of models corresponding to the shapes of individual turtles. Models were assigned identical material properties and loaded under identical conditions, and the stresses produced by a series of eight loads were extracted to describe the strength of the shells. “Lotic” shell shapes produced significantly higher stresses than “lentic” shell shapes, indicating that the former is weaker than the latter. Females had significantly stronger shell shapes than males, although these differences were less consistent than differences between flow regimes. We conclude that, despite the potential for many‐to‐one mapping of shell shape onto strength, P. concinna experiences a trade‐off in shell shape between hydrodynamic and mechanical performance. This trade‐off may be evident in many other turtle species or any other aquatic species that also depend on a shell for defense. However, evolution of body size may provide an avenue of escape from this trade‐off in some cases, as changes in size can drastically affect mechanical performance while having little effect on hydrodynamic performance.

It is estimated that brain injuries account for 15% of the burden of fatalities and disabilities, and represent the leading cause of death in young adults. Brain injury may be caused by an impact or a sudden change in the linear and/or angular velocity of the head. However, the woodpecker does not experience any head injury at the high speed of 6–7 m/s with a deceleration of 1000 g when it drums a tree trunk. It is still not known how woodpeckers protect their brain from impact injury. In order to investigate this, two synchronous high-speed video systems were used to observe the pecking process, and the force sensor was used to measure the peck force. The mechanical properties and macro/micro morphological structure in woodpecker's head were investigated using a mechanical testing system and micro-CT scanning. Finite element (FE) models of the woodpecker's head were established to study the dynamic intracranial responses. The result showed that macro/micro morphology of cranial bone and beak can be recognized as a major contributor to non-impact-injuries.

Structural studies of the bacterial chaperonin, GroEL, both alone and in complex with its co-chaperonin, GroES, have resolved the states of chaperonin that bind and fold non-native polypeptides. Functional studies have resolved the action of ATP binding and hydrolysis in driving the GroEL–GroES machine through its folding-active and binding-active states, respectively. Yet the exact fate of substrate polypeptide during these steps is only poorly understood. For example, while binding involves multivalent interactions between hydrophobic side-chains facing the central cavity of GroEL and exposed hydrophobic surfaces of the non-native protein, the structure of any polypeptide substrate while bound to GroEL remains unknown. It is also unclear whether binding to an open GroEL ring is accompanied by structural changes in the non-native substrate, in particular whether there is an unfolding action. As a polypeptide-bound ring becomes associated with GroES, do the large rigid-body movements of the GroEL apical domains serve as another source of a potential unfolding action? Regarding the encapsulated folding-active state, how does the central cavity itself influence the folding trajectory of a substrate? Finally, how do GroEL and GroES serve, as recently recognized, to assist the folding of substrates too large to be encapsulated inside the machine? Here, such questions are addressed with the findings available to date, and means of further resolving the states of chaperonin-associated polypeptide are discussed.",0.004519397,0.005743302,0.029891366,0.005362746,0.01140137,0.018263098,0.006118743,0.007309335,0.9089088,0.007205414,0.008883758,0.019652244,0.008025128,0.003291479,0.01324254,0.015750492,0.006429266,0.009588264,0.00592861,0.015105133,0.009483496,0.008462811,0.021944866,0.011658356,0.003713574,0.008510112,0.005585169,0.011098856,0.006349894,"['providencia rettgeri', 'bacteria']","[0.016129032258064002, 0.08064516129032201]","[0.2, 1.0]"

Colonization of humans with these organisms was nearly universal until the early 20th century. More than 1,000,000,000 people in less developed countries carry helminths even today. Helminths must quell their host's immune system to successfully colonize. It is likely that helminths sense hostile changes in the local host environment and take action to control such responses. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) probably results from an inappropriately vigorous immune response to contents of the intestinal lumen. Environmental factors strongly affect the risk for IBD. People living in less developed countries are protected from IBD. The “IBD hygiene hypothesis” states that raising children in extremely hygienic environments negatively affects immune development, which predisposes them to immunological diseases like IBD later in life. Modern day absence of exposure to intestinal helminths appears to be an important environmental factor contributing to development of these illnesses. Helminths interact with both host innate and adoptive immunity to stimulate immune regulatory circuitry and to dampen effector pathways that drive aberrant inflammation.

Trees are traditionally considered as distinct entities even though they can share a communal root system through root grafts, which are morphological unions between two or more roots. Little is known regarding the ecological significance of natural root grafting, but because grafted trees can share resources and secondary compounds, growth of linked trees can be affected directly by the presence of root grafts. Traditional forest ecology concepts may have to be revised to include direct interactions between connected trees.


METHODS
We hydraulically excavated six 30-50-m(2) plots (three natural stands and three plantations). We measured yearly radial growth and determined the influence of root grafting on radial growth of grafted trees.


KEY RESULTS
During periods of root graft formation, root grafting tended to reduce radial growth of jack pine trees, after which growth generally increased. The influence of root grafting on growth was more significant in natural stands, where root grafting was more frequent than in plantations.


CONCLUSIONS
These results suggest that root grafting initially is an energetically costly process but that it is afterward nonprejudicial and maybe beneficial to tree growth. The use of a communal root system allows for a maximum use of resources by redistributing them among trees, leading to increased tree growth.",0.9205479,0.008293426,0.016742341,0.01067601,0.008538923,0.009164555,0.006760959,0.003670984,0.003929811,0.014651458,0.011469197,0.008911704,0.009658437,0.015563596,0.008384714,0.008809802,0.004564629,0.010153538,0.02071467,0.015064236,0.009733232,0.006971093,0.013488069,0.007019193,0.007842112,0.006703638,0.005610031,0.010095723,0.012184769,['isurus oxyrinchus'],[0.0125],[1.0]

And, it can decrease the range, speed, and maneuverability of these vessels and increase the fuel consumption. Contrarily, the sharks remain largely free of bioadhesion despite spending their entire lives submerged. The sharks have placoid scales, which consist of rectangular base embedded in the skin with tiny spines that poke up from the surface. It is found that this special structure can make great deal of function for antifouling. In our report, parallel works for antifouling mechanisms were motivated by Triakidae shark feeding, observations on shark skin, and the experiments of benthic diatoms adhesion and Mytilus edulis byssus attachment. And, the optical configurations were acquired by using 3D video microscope and environment scanning electron microscope (ESEM). The results showed that, the benthic diatoms adhesion on the naked skin of living sharks was obviously fewer than the dead ones, and could not be found on the surface of placoid scales. As the time progressed, the rate of Mytilus edulis byssus attachment reduced gradually. It was thought that, the water turbulent boundary on the surface was changed greatly and innumerable minimal vortex was generated when the water flow on the shark skin. The strong exchange of momentum in a turbulent boundary layer would produce high-speed lumps approaching the surface, which could develop strong shear stress. Benthic diatoms and mussel could not attached firmly or be cleared easily when the shear stress became stronger than the adhesion power of these organisms. After finding the real working mechanism of antifouling for sharks, it could be used to direct the progresses of synthesizing biomimetic coatings or materials with antifouling performance in the future.",0.007354138,0.007979252,0.004589601,0.005662346,0.009706203,0.007265347,0.008684024,0.004969863,0.006901383,0.008956847,0.010863938,0.007092515,0.01205445,0.007154198,0.005668478,0.010267008,0.007750574,0.005954469,0.006503145,0.007454817,0.009839068,0.010043532,0.00852987,0.007731371,0.009391677,0.9248475,0.006437734,0.011019328,0.006351498,['strongylocentrotus purpuratus'],[0.009009009009009],[1.0]

These threads are formed of regularly spaced aqueous droplets that surround a pair of supporting axial fibers. When a thread is flattened on a microscope slide a small, opaque granule can usually be seen within each droplet. These granules have been thought to be the glycoprotein glue that imparts thread adhesion. Both independent contrast and standard regressions showed that granule size is directly related to droplet volume and indicated that granule volume is about 15% of droplet volume. We attempted to find support for the hypothesized adhesive role of granules by establishing an association between the contact surface area and volume of these granules and the stickiness of the viscous threads of 16 species in the context of a six-variable model that describes thread stickiness. However, we found that granule size made either an insignificant or a small negative contribution to thread stickiness. Consequently, we hypothesize that granules serve to anchor larger, surrounding layers of transparent glycoprotein glue to the axial fibers of the thread, thereby equipping droplets to resist slippage on the axial fibers as these droplets generate adhesion, elongate under a load, and transfer force to the axial fibers.",0.018350083,0.028650228,0.032791387,0.01394515,0.907497,0.02557186,0.053952917,0.042697147,0.037283424,0.070711605,0.014549104,0.010324142,0.0240055,0.02690005,0.85767466,0.018494027,0.02306339,0.02828667,0.025781484,0.013050219,0.03473676,0.019848358,0.017572116,0.035938095,0.060129516,0.016731236,0.8329837,0.028402878,0.016784286,['equine'],[0.023255813953488],[1.0]

Current thinking holds that wood density mediates a tradeoff between strength and economy of construction, with higher wood density providing higher strength but at higher cost. 2. Yet the further away wood fibres are from the central axis of the trunk, the more they increase the strength of the trunk; thus, a fat trunk of low-density wood can achieve greater strength at lower construction cost than a thin trunk of high-density wood. 3. What then are the countervailing advantages of high wood density? 4. We hypothesize that high wood density is associated with lower maintenance costs due to lower trunk surface area, as surface area correlates with maintenance respiration. 5. This advantage would be particularly important to long-lived trees and could in part explain why they tend to have high wood density. 6. High wood density has also been associated with lower risk of trunk breakage, xylem implosion and pathogen invasion, but we argue that these relationships are not causal and instead reflect correlated selection on other traits of value to long-lived trees. 7. This revaluation of the costs and benefits of high wood density has important implications for understanding tree life-history evolution, functional diversity, forest carbon stocks and the impacts of global change.",0.009589215,0.004081092,0.014899286,0.003211239,0.916524,0.004876537,0.02589196,0.02112491,0.012772716,0.010519831,0.009513806,0.004452967,0.005868167,0.005896313,0.008549999,0.011683651,0.006823819,0.006735607,0.008661697,0.003668859,0.01721924,0.004739908,0.009659276,0.007060324,0.022525184,0.011759375,0.017478732,0.007543635,0.008564993,['nereocystis luetkeana'],[0.009174311926605],[1.0]

This is largely due to an inherent difficulty in isolating them from their surrounding tissues. Echinoderms have collagenous tissues that are similar to ours in many ways, yet they can be manipulated to easily relinquish their collagen fibrils, providing an excellent opportunity to study native fibrillar structure. In the early 1990s, they were found to defy the commonly accepted fibrillar model of the time in that they were much shorter, they were shaped like double‐ended spindles, and their centers exhibited a reversal in molecular polarity. Realization of these features helped to reform the questions that were being asked about vertebrate fibrils, shifting the focus toward shape and size. Since then, researchers working with both groups (echinoderms and vertebrates) have worked together to find the structure of native fibrils. This information will be fundamental in understanding what holds collagenous tissues together at the fibrillar level, and could have important implications for people with Ehlers‐Danlos syndrome.

Using two Eucalyptus species that contrast in drought tolerance, we induced moderate and severe water deficits by withholding water until stomatal conductance (g(sw)) decreased to two pre-defined values for 24 d, WS was maintained at the target g(sw) for 29 d and then plants were re-watered. Additionally, we developed new equations to simulate the effect on mesophyll conductance (g(m)) of accounting for the resistance to refixation of CO(2). The diffusive limitations to CO(2), dominated by the stomata, were the most important constraints to A(n). Full recovery of A(n) was reached after re-watering, characterized by quick recovery of gm and even higher biochemical capacity, in contrast to the slower recovery of g(sw). The acclimation to long-term WS led to decreased mesophyll and biochemical limitations, in contrast to studies in which stress was imposed more rapidly. Finally, we provide evidence that higher gm under WS contributes to higher intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) and reduces the leaf oxidative stress, highlighting the importance of gm as a target for breeding/genetic engineering.",0.53877395,0.004390129,0.01541496,0.007438491,0.005236059,0.006721489,0.005754845,0.003863678,0.010116545,0.005267434,0.011159441,0.007000765,0.005834211,0.004365134,0.005459127,0.026615025,0.002298573,0.004229031,0.006717091,0.017780066,0.004036482,0.004257681,0.022687033,0.00439845,0.004211205,0.00371677,0.003695117,0.009041279,0.007031201,[],[],[]

At the core of a chameleon's tongue is a cylindrical tongue skeleton surrounded by the accelerator muscle. Previously, the cylindrical accelerator muscle was assumed to power tongue projection directly during the actual fast projection of the tongue. However, high–speed recordings of Chamaeleo melleri and C. pardalis reveal that peak powers of 3000 W kg⊃–1 are necessary to generate the observed accelerations, which exceed the accelerator muscle's capacity by at least five– to 10–fold. Extrinsic structures might power projection via the tongue skeleton. High–speed fluoroscopy suggests that they contribute less than 10% of the required peak instantaneous power. Thus, the projection power must be generated predominantly within the tongue, and an energy–storage–and–release mechanism must be at work. The key structure in the projection mechanism is probably a cylindrical connective–tissue layer, which surrounds the entoglossal process and was previously suggested to act as lubricating tissue. This tissue layer comprises at least 10 sheaths that envelop the entoglossal process. The outer portion connects anteriorly to the accelerator muscle and the inner portion to the retractor structures. The sheaths contain helical arrays of collagen fibres. Prior to projection, the sheaths are longitudinally loaded by the combined radial contraction and hydrostatic lengthening of the accelerator muscle, at an estimated mean power of 144 W kg⊃–1 in C. melleri. Tongue projection is triggered as the accelerator muscle and the loaded portions of the sheaths start to slide over the tip of the entoglossal process. The springs relax radially while pushing off the rounded tip of the entoglossal process, making the elastic energy stored in the helical fibres available for a simultaneous forward acceleration of the tongue pad, accelerator muscle and retractor structures. The energy release continues as the multilayered spring slides over the tip of the smooth and lubricated entoglossal process. This sliding–spring theory predicts that the sheaths deliver most of the instantaneous power required for tongue projection. The release power of the sliding tubular springs exceeds the work rate of the accelerator muscle by at least a factor of 10 because the elastic–energy release occurs much faster than the loading process. Thus, we have identified a unique catapult mechanism that is very different from standard engineering designs. Our morphological and kinematic observations, as well as the available literature data, are consistent with the proposed mechanism of tongue projection, although experimental tests of the sheath strain and the lubrication of the entoglossal process are currently beyond our technical scope.",0.029682372,0.016178567,0.037684813,0.019925678,0.04026774,0.03202068,0.044805907,0.011578028,0.019626372,0.012035797,0.015091215,0.013978492,0.03251077,0.030890182,0.023318136,0.008299864,0.80608654,0.026234949,0.03550963,0.025470363,0.73808426,0.03176021,0.036683567,0.017866166,0.021746233,0.016465178,0.011884555,0.014048349,0.03838293,['crassicorophium bonellii'],[0.016666666666666],[1.0]

We showed earlier the presence of superparamagnetic magnetite in iron granules formed in honeybees, and subscribed to the notion that external magnetic fields may cause expansion or contraction of the superparamagnetic particles in an orientation-specific manner, relaying the signal via cytoskeleton (Hsu and Li 1994). In this study, we established a size-density purification procedure, with which quantitative amount of iron granules was obtained from honey bee trophocytes and characterized; the density of iron granules was determined to be 1.25 g/cm3. While we confirmed the presence of superparamagnetic magnetite in the iron granules, we observed changes in the size of the magnetic granules in the trophycytes upon applying additional magnetic field to the cells. A concomitant release of calcium ion was observed by confocal microscope. This size fluctuation triggered the increase of intracellular Ca+2 , which was inhibited by colchicines and latrunculin B, known to be blockers for microtubule and microfilament syntheses, respectively. The associated cytoskeleton may thus relay the magnetosignal, initiating a neural response.

While AQPs facilitate transmembrane permeation of water and/or small neutral solutes, they preclude the conduction of protons. Consequently, openings of AQP channels allow rapid water diffusion down an osmotic gradient without dissipating electrochemical potentials.

Physical ecosystem engineering by organisms is the physical modification, maintenance, or creation of habitats. Ecological effects of engineers on many other species occur in virtually all ecosystems because the physical state changes directly create nonfood resources such as living space, directly control abiotic resources, and indirectly modulate abiotic forces that, in turn, affect resource use by other organisms. Trophic interactions and resource competition do not constitute engineering. Engineering can have significant or trivial effects on other species, may involve the physical structure of an organism (like a tree) or structures made by an organism (like a beaver dam), and can, but does not invariably, have feedback effects on the engineer. We argue that engineering has both negative and positive effects on species richness and abundances at small scales, but the net effects are probably positive at larger scales encompassing engineered and nonengineered environments in ecological and evolutionary space and time. Models of the population dynamics of engineers suggest that the engineer/habitat equilibrium is often, but not always, locally stable and may show long-term cycles, with potential ramifications for community and ecosystem stability. As yet, data adequate to parameterize such a model do not exist for any engineer species. Because engineers control flows of energy and materials but do not have to participate in these flows, energy, mass, and stoichiometry do not appear to be useful in predicting which engineers will have big effects. Empirical observations suggest some potential generalizations about which species will be important engineers in which ecosystems. We point out some of the obvious, and not so obvious, ways in which engineering and trophic relations interact, and we call for greater research on physical ecosystem engineers, their impacts, and their interface with trophic relations.",0.113847844,0.002693913,0.027719358,0.010654114,0.010248176,0.002100236,0.002362654,0.020360073,0.007795902,0.013384502,0.012343935,0.023839688,0.01496093,0.021583635,0.00491969,0.004981485,0.002268898,0.005792662,0.22738768,0.004168494,0.005096287,0.007360518,0.006782228,0.006886549,0.004948857,0.006199417,0.003696251,0.010997021,0.006818863,"['bacteria', 'deinococcus radiodurans']","[0.07352941176470501, 0.014705882352941001]","[1.0, 0.199999999999999]"

Many species of waterfowl breed in high latitudes where rapid heat loss can necessitate a high energetic input from parents and use down feathers to line their nests. Common eider Somateria mollissima nest down has exceptional insulating properties but the microstructural mechanisms behind the feather properties have not been thoroughly examined. 
 
Here, we hypothesized that insulating properties of nest down are correlated to down feather (plumule) microstructure. We tested the thermal efficiency (fill power) and cohesion of plumules from nests of two Icelandic colonies of wild common eiders and compared them to properties of plumules of wild greylag goose Anser anser. We then used electron microscopy to examine the morphological basis of feather insulating properties. We found that greylag goose down has higher fill power (i.e. traps more air) but much lower cohesion (i.e. less prone to stick together) compared to common eider down. These differences were related to interspecific variation in feather microstructure. Down cohesion increased with the number of barbule microstructures (prongs) that create strong points of contact among feathers. Eider down feathers also had longer barbules than greylag goose down feathers, likely increasing their air-trapping capacity. Feather properties of these two species might reflect the demands of their contrasting evolutionary history. In greylag goose, a temperate, terrestrial species, plumule microstructure may optimize heat trapping. In common eiders, a diving duck that nests in arctic and subarctic waters, plumule structure may have evolved to maximize cohesion over thermal insulation, which would both reduce buoyancy during their foraging dives and enable nest down to withstand strong arctic winds.",0.008228635,0.013451413,0.008485552,0.004391244,0.010550454,0.015575955,0.009604716,0.005666987,0.009371907,0.006959435,0.010169946,0.00567392,0.007096267,0.004513247,0.004057751,0.014839566,0.006461255,0.008585883,0.005829497,0.010198012,0.009928391,0.007174025,0.9477551,0.004031626,0.009162369,0.007812779,0.007166479,0.008600162,0.011361023,['plants'],[0.008474576271186],[1.0]

Because the beetles then fly to newly-decaying Ficus for mating and oviposition, they act as effective dispersal agents. Field experiments and observations indicate that this dispersal mode has been exploited by males who compete to remain on a beetle as a strategic site for inseminating females dispersing on it and on other beetles. Whereas beetles just eclosed from old trees carried large, female-biased groups of dispersing pseudoscorpions, beetles captured after their maiden flight generally carried a single large male. Multivariate morphometric analyses indicated that these beetle-riding males were much larger than individuals randomly sampled from trees, with fighting traits exhibiting the greatest potential for selection (highest “phoretic” differentials). In females, sexual receptivity was significantly higher at the beginning of dispersal than at the end, suggesting that mating occurs on beetles. Field experiments confirmed that on-beetle insemination does take place and that small males are displaced from the “subelytral space” by larger rivals. By contrast, laboratory experiments suggest that large male size may not confer high mating success under the low-density conditions which characterize populations within trees. Thus, in addition to indicating a novel role for dispersal in the evolution of exaggerated male traits, this study suggests that oscillating sexual selection may be important in the maintenance of the extreme phenotypic variation exhibited by males of this species.",0.044377804,0.012846726,0.907095,0.007397711,0.017107328,0.008431004,0.008900832,0.021414513,0.0600992,0.015013507,0.009451866,0.008201854,0.01295905,0.006745184,0.011171588,0.010710944,0.010684026,0.007689889,0.007548438,0.010768317,0.010264237,0.010106302,0.022931,0.051764,0.009594882,0.00648759,0.00421591,0.012651547,0.01734564,"['oryza sativa', 'plants', 'rice', 'echinochloa crus-galli']","[0.0, 0.05617977528089801, 0.12359550561797701, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.45454545454545403, 1.0, 0.0]"

Current literature conflicts on whether sharkskin is able to reduce skin friction similar to riblets. To contribute insights toward reconciling these conflicting views, direct numerical simulations are carried out to obtain detailed flow fields around realistic denticles. A sharp interface immersed boundary method is employed to simulate two arrangements of actual sharkskin denticles (from Isurus oxyrinchus) in a turbulent boundary layer at Reτ ≈ 180. For comparison, turbulent flow over drag-reducing scalloped riblets is also simulated with similar flow conditions and with the same numerical method. Although the denticles resemble riblets, both sharkskin arrangements increase total drag by 44%-50%, while the riblets reduce drag by 5%. Analysis of the simulated flow fields shows that the turbulent flow around denticles is highly three-dimensional and separated, with 25% of the total drag being form drag. The complex three-dimensional shape of the denticles gives rise to a mean flow dominated by strong secondary flows in sharp contrast with the mean flow generated by riblets, which is largely two-dimensional. The so resulting three-dimensionality of sharkskin flows leads to an increase in the magnitude of the turbulent statistics near the denticles, which further contributes to increasing the total drag. The simulations also show that, at least for the simulated arrangements, sharkskin, in sharp contrast with drag-reducing riblets, is unable to isolate high shear stress near denticle ridges causing a significant portion of the denticle surface to be exposed to high mean shear.",0.036815472,0.018137062,0.01619983,0.012738801,0.01831538,0.8835865,0.009439437,0.011769138,0.034121048,0.03105711,0.02274532,0.012463767,0.021847155,0.014111046,0.012213488,0.011265218,0.029260095,0.019020857,0.011349878,0.87360483,0.013740789,0.014580085,0.03255496,0.028363988,0.019691965,0.02166082,0.018189352,0.015249223,0.035434503,"['tilapia', 'fish', 'anchovies', 'fishes']","[0.017241379310344, 0.034482758620689, 0.017241379310344, 0.017241379310344]","[0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5]"

We analyzed the movements of 39 specimens of S. purpuratus after they were placed in the center of a featureless tank containing a round, black target that had an angular diameter of 6.5 deg. or 10 deg. (solid angles of 0.01 sr and 0.024 sr, respectively). An average orientation vector for each urchin was determined by testing the animal four times, with the target placed successively at bearings of 0 deg., 90 deg., 180 deg. and 270 deg. (relative to magnetic east). The urchins showed no significant unimodal or axial orientation relative to any non-target feature of the environment or relative to the changing position of the 6.5 deg. target. However, the urchins were strongly axially oriented relative to the changing position of the 10 deg. target (mean axis from –1 to 179 deg.; 95% confidence interval ± 12 deg.; P<0.001, Moore's non-parametric Hotelling's test), with 10 of the 20 urchins tested against that target choosing an average bearing within 10 deg. of either the target center or its opposite direction (two would be expected by chance). In addition, the average length of the 20 target-normalized bearings for the 10 deg. target (each the vector sum of the bearings for the four trials) were far higher than would be expected by chance (P<10−10; Monte Carlo simulation), showing that each urchin, whether it moved towards or away from the target, did so with high consistency. These results strongly suggest that S. purpuratus detected the 10 deg. target, responding either by approaching it or fleeing it. Given that the urchins did not appear to respond to the 6.5 deg. target, it is likely that the 10 deg. target was close to the minimum detectable size for this species. Interestingly, measurements of the spine density of the regions of the test that faced horizontally predicted a similar visual resolution (8.3±0.5 deg. for the interambulacrum and 11±0.54 deg. for the ambulacrum). The function of this relatively low, but functional, acuity – on par with that of the chambered Nautilus and the horseshoe crab – is unclear but, given the bimodal response, is likely to be related to both shelter seeking and predator avoidance.",0.016917426,0.8761898,0.014090377,0.013660928,0.009595797,0.012537875,0.00936047,0.012897633,0.009184377,0.008571603,0.004950045,0.007829423,0.010453789,0.011252028,0.007854953,0.005377493,0.008750308,0.014603375,0.00935662,0.010442454,0.008183888,0.015858468,0.025668673,0.008601069,0.010558751,0.013078347,0.014073144,0.00892881,0.01492022,[],[],[]

The comparative study of this pattern is feasible and informative in orders such as Plecoptera, Ephemeroptera, Odonata, Diptera and Trichoptera in which all members of a population pass through the water-surface when emerging. Methods by which emergence rate can be measured are discussed. Four basic temporal patterns of emergence exist. Emergence may be (1) continuous with irregular fluctuations in rate; (2) rhythmic, with a lunar period; (3) sporadic, occurring at irregular intervals of a few days; or (4) seasonal. Examples of each of these patterns are given, and reference is made to the proximate and ultimate environmental factors which may be maintaining the patterns observed. Diurnal rhythms of emergence are excluded from consideration. When emergence is restricted seasonally in temperate latitudes, the degree of its synchronization within the emergence period varies widely but is usually constant and typical for a given species.

We used the giant bull kelp, Nereocystis luetkeana, to investigate how these ecomorphological differences are produced. The undulate blades of N. luetkeana from sites with low flow remain spread out and flutter erratically in moving water, thereby not only enhancing interception of light, but also increasing drag. In contrast, strap-like blades of kelp from habitats with rapid flow collapse into streamlined bundles and flutter at low amplitude in flowing water, thus reducing both drag and interception of light. Transplant experiments in the field revealed that shape of the blade in N. luetkeana is a plastic trait. Laboratory experiments in which growing blades from different sites were subjected to tensile forces that mimicked the hydrodynamic drag experienced by blades in different flow regimes showed that change in shape is induced by mechanical stress. During growth experiments in the field and laboratory, we mapped the spatial distribution of growth in both undulate and strap-like blades to determine how these different morphologies were produced. The highest growth rates occur near the proximal ends of N. luetkeana blades of both morphologies, but the rates of transverse growth of narrow, strap-like blades are lower than those of wide, undulate blades. If rates of longitudinal growth at the edges of a blade exceed the rate of longitudinal growth along the midline of the blade, ruffles along the edges of the blade are produced by elastic buckling. In contrast, flat blades are produced when rates of longitudinal growth are similar across the width of a blade. Because ruffles are the result of elastic buckling, a compliant undulate N. luetkeana blade can easily be pushed into different configurations (e.g., the wavelengths of the ruffles along the edges of the blade can change, and the whole blade can twist into left- and right-handed helicoidal shapes), which may enhance movements of the blade in flowing water that reduce self-shading and increase mass exchange along blade surfaces.",0.024694238,0.014378389,0.87064284,0.011713658,0.025665043,0.021358656,0.013428514,0.024956835,0.8910546,0.0086828,0.018002557,0.02941449,0.020960517,0.007510269,0.015213369,0.016053518,0.016876578,0.011609125,0.012227088,0.024021463,0.02068238,0.014520813,0.02427302,0.042648252,0.00925445,0.011332992,0.006132146,0.017410496,0.01359047,['bats'],[0.043956043956043],[1.0]

Together with nematodes and bdelloid rotifers, tardigrades are known to enter quiescence (with several forms of cryptobiosis: anhydrobiosis, cryobiosis, anoxybiosis, osmobiosis) at any stage of their life cycle, from egg to adult. Entering anhydrobiosis, tardigrades contract their body into a so-called tun, loosing most of their free and bound water (>95%), synthesizing cell protectants (e.g., trehalose, glycerol, heat shock proteins) and strongly reducing or suspending their metabolism. Our research on cryptobiosis focused on some ecological and evolutionary aspects. We evaluated: i) the long-term anhydrobiotic survival by comparing quantitative data on recovery from naturally induced desiccation in several species of tardigrades; ii) differences in survival patterns between species and populations by experimentally inducing anhydrobiosis and cryobiosis; iii) phenotypic factors affecting anhydrobiotic survival. As regards diapause, we considered encystment and eggs. Encystment involves at least the synthesis of new cuticular structures. Morphological changes during cyst formation are more complex than those involved in tun formation. We analyzed more in detail encystment processes, comparing a semiterrestrial with a limnic species. Several inter-specific differences have been identified, other than the production of two types of cysts in the semiterrestrial species. Our analysis of life history traits of a laboratory reared strain of a soil tardigrade revealed a particular hatching phenology that involved the production of both subitaneous and resting eggs. The latter need a cue to hatch (dehydration followed by re-hydration).

Cell-to-cell communication between bacteria is mediated by small diffusible signal molecules that trigger changes in gene expression in response to fluctuations in population density. This process, generally referred to as quorum sensing (QS), controls diverse phenotypes in numerous Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Recent advances have revealed that bacteria are not limited to communication within their own species but are capable of ‘listening in’ and ‘broadcasting to’ unrelated species to intercept messages and coerce cohabitants into behavioural modifications, either for the good of the population or for the benefit of one species over another. It is also evident that QS is not limited to the bacterial kingdom.

Yet, many prokaryotes are killed by doses of IR that cause little DNA damage. Here we have probed the nature of Mn-facilitated IR resistance in Deinococcus radiodurans, which together with other extremely IR-resistant bacteria have high intracellular Mn/Fe concentration ratios compared to IR-sensitive bacteria. For in vitro and in vivo irradiation, we demonstrate a mechanistic link between Mn(II) ions and protection of proteins from oxidative modifications that introduce carbonyl groups. Conditions that inhibited Mn accumulation or Mn redox cycling rendered D. radiodurans radiation sensitive and highly susceptible to protein oxidation. X-ray fluorescence microprobe analysis showed that Mn is globally distributed in D. radiodurans, but Fe is sequestered in a region between dividing cells. For a group of phylogenetically diverse IR-resistant and IR-sensitive wild-type bacteria, our findings support the idea that the degree of resistance is determined by the level of oxidative protein damage caused during irradiation. We present the case that protein, rather than DNA, is the principal target of the biological action of IR in sensitive bacteria, and extreme resistance in Mn-accumulating bacteria is based on protein protection.",0.003733948,0.00434465,0.003964021,0.005238248,0.007295236,0.00385571,0.006364044,0.007691651,0.014351647,0.002717928,0.23390354,0.022129454,0.014343022,0.001530709,0.003858155,0.012754709,0.002532455,0.006148821,0.008757426,0.004510904,0.02165891,0.005366054,0.028560525,0.005553308,0.007005679,0.014670257,0.0038877,0.005374844,0.00386174,"['bacteria', 'alvinella pompejana']","[0.045454545454545005, 0.022727272727272003]","[1.0, 0.5]"

This is utilised by Darkling beetles (Tenebrionidae) that employ different strategies for obtaining the fog water. Some dig trenches in the sand, while others use their own bodies as fog collectors assuming a characteristic fog-basking stance. Two beetle species from the genus Onymacris have been observed to fog-bask on the ridges of the sand dunes. These beetles all have smooth elytra surfaces, while another species with elytra covered in bumps is reported to have specialised adaptations facilitating water capture by fog-basking. To resolve if these other beetles also fog-bask, and if an elytra covered in bumps is a more efficient fog water collector than a smooth one, we examined four Namib Desert beetles; the smooth Onymacris unguicularis and O. laeviceps and the bumpy Stenocara gracilipes and Physasterna cribripes. Here we describe the beetles' fog-basking behaviour, the details of their elytra structures, and determine how efficient their dorsal surface areas are at harvesting water from fog.ResultsThe beetles differ greatly in size. The largest P. cribripes has a dorsal surface area that is 1.39, 1.56, and 2.52 times larger than O. unguicularis, O. laeviceps, and S. gracilipes, respectively. In accordance with earlier reports, we found that the second largest O. unguicularis is the only one of the four beetles that assumes the head standing fog-basking behaviour, and that fog is necessary to trigger this behaviour. No differences were seen in the absolute amounts of fog water collected on the dorsal surface areas of the different beetles. However, data corrected according to the sizes of the beetles revealed differences. The better fog water harvesters were S. gracilipes and O. unguicularis while the large P. cribripes was the poorest. Examination of the elytra microstructures showed clear structural differences, but the elytra of all beetles were found to be completely hydrophobic.ConclusionsThe differences in fog water harvesting efficiency by the dorsal surface areas of beetles with very different elytra surface structures were minor. We therefore conclude that the fog-basking behaviour itself is a more important factor than structural adaptations when O. unguicularis collect water from fog.",0.6048652,0.00727292,0.00828849,0.005253302,0.004222748,0.010486741,0.004136493,0.003580083,0.004596038,0.010211618,0.005853978,0.00615433,0.006886311,0.005618609,0.005773334,0.007335885,0.002737782,0.010464543,0.00999378,0.035836317,0.006829234,0.003224594,0.012770833,0.004164092,0.005097247,0.003754998,0.005236037,0.017365264,0.006025806,['beetles'],[0.035714285714285005],[1.0]

In Europe, EU legislation (the Water Framework Directive and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive), international conventions (OSPAR, HELCOM) and national environmental objectives emphasize the need to reduce the input of nutrients to freshwater and marine environments. A widely used method to achieve this is to allow water to pass through a created or restored wetland. However, the large variation in measured nutrient removal rates in such wetlands calls for a systematic review.MethodsSearches for primary studies were performed in electronic databases and on the internet. One author performed the screening of all retrieved articles at the title and abstract level. To check that the screening was consistent and complied with the agreed inclusion/exclusion criteria, subsets of 100 articles were screened by the other authors. When screening at full-text level the articles were evenly distributed among the authors. Kappa tests were used to evaluate screening consistency. Relevant articles remaining after screening were critically appraised and assigned to three quality categories, from two of which data were extracted. Quantitative synthesis consists of meta-analyses and response surface analyses. Regressions were performed using generalized additive models that can handle nonlinear relationships and interaction effects.ResultsSearches generated 5853 unique records. After screening on relevance and critical appraisal, 93 articles including 203 wetlands were used for data extraction. Most of the wetlands were situated in Europe and North America. The removal rate of both total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) is highly dependent on the loading rate. Significant relationships were also found for annual average air temperature (T) and wetland area (A). Median removal rates of TN and TP were 93 and 1.2 g m−2 year−1, respectively. Removal efficiency for TN was significantly correlated with hydrologic loading rate (HLR) and T, and the median was 37 %, with a 95 % confidence interval of 29–44 %. Removal efficiency for TP was significantly correlated with inlet TP concentration, HLR, T, and A. Median TP removal efficiency was 46 % with a 95 % confidence interval of 37–55 %. Although there are small differences in average values between the two quality categories, the variation is considerably smaller among high quality studies compared to studies with lower quality. This suggests that part of the large variation between studies may be explained by less rigorous study designs.ConclusionsOn average, created and restored wetlands significantly reduce the transport of TN and TP in treated wastewater and urban and agricultural runoff, and may thus be effective in efforts to counteract eutrophication. However, restored wetlands on former farmland were significantly less efficient than other wetlands at TP removal. In addition, wetlands with precipitation-driven HLRs and/or hydrologic pulsing show significantly lower TP removal efficiencies compared to wetlands with controlled HLRs. Loading rate (inlet concentrations × hydraulic loading rates) needs to be carefully estimated as part of the wetland design. More research is needed on the effects of hydrologic pulsing on wetlands. There is also a lack of evidence for long-term (>20 years) performance of wetlands.",0.21778627,0.006554647,0.014317501,0.009899433,0.004858817,0.004876207,0.003297496,0.01145089,0.008809023,0.004969318,0.028339462,0.016223414,0.07410874,0.010595264,0.005381392,0.001891902,0.004135217,0.005302295,0.085113935,0.005968329,0.01462118,0.006600909,0.004620536,0.005220175,0.004197745,0.007453535,0.003812837,0.008401978,0.003938492,['bacteria'],[0.015625],[1.0]

All insects, however, begin life as eggs and lack the ability to thermoregulate. Eggs laid on leaves experience a thermal environment, and thus a body temperature, that is strongly influenced by the leaves themselves. Because plants can maintain leaf temperatures that differ from ambient, e.g. by evapotranspiration, plant hosts may protect eggs from extreme ambient temperatures. We examined the degree to which leaves buffer ambient thermal variation and whether that buffering benefits leaf-associated insect eggs. In particular, we: (1) measured temperature variation at oviposition sites in the field, (2) manipulated temperatures in the laboratory to determine the effect of different thermal conditions on embryo development time and survival, and (3) tested embryonic metabolic rates over increasing temperatures. Our results show that Datura wrightii leaves buffer Manduca sexta eggs from fatally high ambient temperatures in the southwestern USA. Moreover, small differences in temperature profiles among leaves can cause large variation in egg metabolic rate and development time. Specifically, large leaves were hotter than small leaves during the day, reaching temperatures that are stressfully high for eggs. This study provides the first mechanistic demonstration of how this type of leaf-constructed thermal refuge interacts with egg physiology.",0.007785061,0.011098318,0.006750106,0.00567036,0.007819979,0.009651429,0.007368933,0.00536378,0.008983714,0.006475848,0.011519117,0.006650462,0.006306713,0.005459958,0.003388711,0.012863942,0.005228033,0.006552282,0.005622254,0.006814128,0.008228202,0.006869179,0.9259865,0.003538352,0.007467369,0.007852426,0.005625417,0.007381636,0.011359353,[],[],[]

Allelopathic rice PI312777 and Huagan-1 at their early growth stages released momilactone B, 3-isopropyl-5-acetoxycyclohexene-2-one-1, and 5,7,4′-trihydroxy-3′,5′-dimethoxyflavone into soil at phytotoxic levels, but non-allelopathic rice Huajingxian did not. Both allelopathic and non-allelopathic rice residues released momilactone B and lignin-related phenolic acids (p-hydroxybenzoic, p-coumaric, ferulic, syringic and vanillic acids) into the soil during residue decomposition to inhibit successive plants. The results indicated that allelochemicals involved in rice allelopathy from living and dead plants are substantially different. Interestingly, the concentrations of the allelochemicals released from the allelopathic rice seedlings in soil increased dramatically when they were surrounded with Echinochloa crus-galli. The concentrations of the allelochemicals were over 3-fold higher in the presence of E. crus-galli than in the absence of E. crus-galli. However, the same case did not occur in non-allelopathic Huajingxian seedlings surrounded with E. crus-galli. In addition to allelochemical exudation being promoted by the presence of E. crus-galli, allelopathic rice seedlings also increased allelochemical exudation in response to exudates of germinated E. crus-galli seeds or lepidimoide, an uronic acid derivative exuded from E. crus-galli seeds. These results imply that allelopathic rice seedlings can sense certain allelochemicals released by E. crus-galli into the soil, and respond by increased production of allelochemicals inhibitory to E. crus-galli. This study suggests that rice residues of both allelopathic and non-allelopathic varieties release similar concentrations and types of allelochemicals to inhibit successive plants. In contrast, living rice plants of certain allelopathic varieties appear to be able to detect the presence of interspecific neighbors and respond by increased allelochemicals.",0.007397788,0.0073892,0.005301603,0.004791996,0.011779758,0.006060462,0.009633647,0.005956281,0.008251676,0.008600716,0.010837074,0.009173193,0.011135741,0.006948015,0.006646557,0.011744982,0.008100685,0.006882607,0.006907353,0.007327057,0.011360241,0.009751411,0.008419953,0.008346025,0.008798458,0.9364562,0.006897874,0.011888784,0.00766016,"['bacteria', 'euprymna scolopes', 'mammals']","[0.007936507936507001, 0.007936507936507001, 0.007936507936507001]","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0]"

Particles are concentrated inside the oral cavity as filtrate exits between the rakers, but particles are not retained on the rakers. Instead, the high-velocity crossflow along the rakers carries particles away from the raker surfaces and transports the particles towards the oesophagus.

Here we report that epithelial cytokeratins have innate defense properties because they constitutively produce cytoprotective antimicrobial peptides. Glycine-rich C-terminal fragments derived from human cytokeratin 6A were identified in bactericidal lysate fractions of human corneal epithelial cells. Structural analysis revealed that these keratin-derived antimicrobial peptides (KDAMPs) exhibited coil structures with low α-helical content. Synthetic analogs of these KDAMPS showed rapid bactericidal activity against multiple pathogens and protected epithelial cells against bacterial virulence mechanisms, while a scrambled peptide showed no bactericidal activity. However, the bactericidal activity of a specific KDAMP was somewhat reduced by glycine-alanine substitutions. KDAMP activity involved bacterial binding and permeabilization, but the activity was unaffected by peptide charge or physiological salt concentration. Knockdown of cytokeratin 6A markedly reduced the bactericidal activity of epithelial cell lysates in vitro and increased the susceptibility of murine corneas to bacterial adherence in vivo.

These results provide experimental evidence that the microlenses are optical elements that guide and focus the light inside the tissue.

The lens array is designed to minimize spherical aberration and birefringence and to detect light from a particular direction.

Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) exhibit multiple changes in neuroendocrine, reproductive, and immune function after exposure to short days. The manner in which these changes are integrated into the host response to pathogens is not well understood. The present experiments tested the hypothesis that short-day changes in immune function alter the pathogenesis of septic shock and survival after challenge with endotoxin. Male and female Siberian hamsters raised in long-day photoperiods were transferred as adults to short days or remained in their natal photoperiod. Six to 8 weeks later, hamsters were injected i.p. with 0, 1, 2.5, 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (the biologically active constituent of endotoxin), and survival was monitored for 96 h. Short days significantly improved survival of male hamsters treated with 10 or 25 mg/kg LPS and improved survival in females treated with 50 mg/kg LPS. Transfer from long to short days shifted the LD5 0 in males by approximately 90%, from 5.3 to 9.9 mg/kg, and in females from 11.1 to 15.0 mg/kg ([#002B]35%). Long-day females were more resistant than were males to lethal endotoxemia. In vitro production of the proinflammatory cytokine TNFα in response to LPS stimulation was significantly lower in macrophages extracted from short-day relative to long-day hamsters, as were circulating concentrations of TNFα in vivo after i.p. administration of LPS, suggesting that diminished cytokine responses to LPS in short days may mitigate the lethality of endotoxemia.

When broadcasts are emitted rapidly in cluttered surroundings, echo streams from successive broadcasts overlap and cause ambiguity in matching echoes to corresponding broadcasts. To identify reactions to ambiguity in clutter, echolocating bats that emit multiple-harmonic FM sounds were trained to fly into a dense, extended array of obstacles (multiple rows of vertically hanging chains) while the sonar sounds the bat emitted were recorded with a miniature radio microphone carried by the bat. Flight paths were reconstructed from thermal-infrared video recordings. Successive rows of chains extended more than 6 m in depth, so each broadcast was followed by a series of echoes from multiple rows of chains that lasted up to 40 ms. Bats emitted sounds in pairs (“strobe groups”) at short (20–40 ms) interpulse intervals (IPIs) alternating with longer IPIs (>50 ms). For many short IPIs, the stream of echoes from the first broadcast was still arriving when the second broadcast was emitted. This overlap caused ambiguity about matching echoes with broadcasts. Bats shifted frequencies of the first sound in each strobe group upward and the second sound downward by 3–6 kHz. When overlap and ambiguity ceased, frequency shifts ceased also. Frequency differences were small compared with the total broadcast band, which was 75–80 kHz wide, but the harmonic structure of echoes enhances the differences in spectrograms.

They were widely reported to reduce the reflectance for normally incident light, contributing to camouflage by reducing glare to predators, while furthermore enhancing the intake of light, which is especially important for nocturnal insects. Our preliminary observations suggest a third function: in contrast to the rest of the body, ommatidia of various insects remain clean, even in a heavy contaminated environment. In order to prove such an anti-contamination hypothesis of these structures, we measured the adhesive properties of polymer moulds of insect ommatidia, and compared these data with control surfaces having the same curvature radii but lacking such a nanostructure. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) study and force measurements using an atomic force microscope (AFM) on the eye surfaces of three different insect species, dragonfly Aeshna mixta (Odonata), moth Laothoe populi (Lepidoptera) and fly Volucella pellucens (Diptera), were undertaken. We revealed that adhesion is greatly reduced by corneal grating in L. populi and V. pellucens when compared with their smooth controls. The smooth cornea of A. mixta showed no statistically significant difference to its control. We assume that this anti-adhesive phenomenon is due to a decrease in the real contact area between contaminating particles and the eye's surface. Such a combination of three functions in one nanostructure can be interesting for the development of industrial multifunctional surfaces capable of enhancing light harvesting while reducing light reflection and adhesion.",0.007622425,0.10048368,0.004248406,0.011473469,0.003764984,0.003929636,0.003382199,0.004308227,0.00599227,0.059575595,0.002447463,0.005548112,0.003912963,0.005832914,0.036794115,0.003193192,0.004116975,0.008951879,0.003574328,0.005374492,0.004129642,0.00777161,0.007292449,0.007868744,0.003509091,0.006242842,0.005513827,0.017916631,0.007595795,"['hagfish', 'hagfishes']","[0.013513513513513, 0.013513513513513]","[1.0, 1.0]"

Fluxes through both pathways were measured in thermoregulating flowers undergoing varying degrees of thermogenesis in response to ambient temperature. Significant increases in alternative pathway flux were found in lotus receptacles with temperatures 16°C to 20°C above ambient, but not in those with lesser amounts of heating. Alternative pathway flux in the hottest receptacles was 75% of the total respiratory flux. In contrast, fluxes through the cytochrome pathway did not change significantly during thermogenesis. These data support the hypothesis that increased flux through the alternative pathway is responsible for heating in the lotus and that it is unlikely that uncoupling proteins, which would have produced increased fluxes through the cytochrome pathway, contribute significantly to heating in this tissue. Comparisons of actual flux, with capacity determined using inhibitors, suggested that the alternative pathway was operating at close to maximum capacity in heating tissues of lotus. However, in nonheating tissues the inhibitor data significantly overestimated the alternative pathway flux. This confirms that isotopic measurements are necessary for accurate determination of fluxes through the two pathways.",0.006747341,0.012305295,0.006862471,0.00439535,0.010961691,0.011005004,0.008962068,0.006198812,0.009166534,0.00709406,0.010595059,0.005849392,0.007162786,0.005062779,0.003330552,0.012714182,0.007004376,0.007634989,0.005678587,0.007908111,0.010335822,0.006485015,0.9403332,0.003734996,0.00848623,0.009037422,0.006761305,0.008630288,0.015194505,"['arthropods', 'jumping spiders', 'phidippus regius', 'spiders']","[0.019230769230769003, 0.0, 0.019230769230769003, 0.019230769230769003]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0]"

Fast snap-trapping and suction of prey are two of the most spectacular examples for how these plants actively catch animals, mainly arthropods, for a substantial nutrient supply. We show that Drosera glanduligera, a sundew from southern Australia, features a sophisticated catapult mechanism: Prey animals walking near the edge of the sundew trigger a touch-sensitive snap-tentacle, which swiftly catapults them onto adjacent sticky glue-tentacles; the insects are then slowly drawn within the concave trap leaf by sticky tentacles. This is the first detailed documentation and analysis of such catapult-flypaper traps in action and highlights a unique and surprisingly complex mechanical adaptation to carnivory.",0.010454632,0.005915658,0.012821631,0.015033208,0.006081176,0.030058248,0.002333577,0.004300932,0.018285533,0.32798964,0.003684597,0.006686365,0.005338955,0.009690356,0.03410362,0.001759864,0.009371261,0.005513192,0.00535984,0.008160319,0.003968402,0.02013985,0.003230857,0.06280807,0.003883812,0.002641709,0.004434108,0.004562353,0.034481898,[],[],[]

The movements of both eyes and the head were recorded with search coils in unrestrained, freely moving chameleons. As a main result I found that the generation of saccades in the left and the right eye was either independent from each other or was highly correlated according to the behavioural situation. When no prey item was fixated, disconjugate saccades were observed which was in accordance with earlier observations in chameleons. During prey tracking the chameleons switched to a different oculomotor behaviour and pursued the moving prey with synchronous saccades. At higher target velocities, the tracking movement of the head was also saccadic and was synchronised with the two eyes. Binocular coupling affected only the timing of the saccades but not the metrics: the amplitudes of the synchronous saccades were usually different in the two eyes. These observations suggest the existence of two independent premotor neuronal circuits for left and right eye saccadic motor control in the chameleon. Binocular coupling in prey-tracking chameleons is probably achieved by neuronal coupling of these premotor circuits during eye–head coordination. The ability to switch between synchronous and uncoupled saccadic eye movements has not been described for any other vertebrate. This unique ability of the chameleon may help to understand the organisation of the oculomotor system of other vertebrates since evidence for separate left eye and right eye saccade generation and position control has recently also been reported in primates.",0.013360616,0.84341305,0.010734915,0.013953565,0.007685058,0.010893229,0.008337016,0.01223554,0.009118108,0.009097993,0.00459418,0.008244933,0.009906648,0.011237544,0.008310825,0.004529006,0.008364337,0.012817678,0.008621623,0.009073591,0.008382348,0.013805534,0.026907105,0.007384365,0.009761275,0.014480385,0.010680367,0.008385583,0.013829608,[],[],[]

In this study, we sought to determine whether symbionts affect host transcriptional rhythms. We identified two transcripts in host tissues (E. scolopes cry1 [escry1] and escry2) that encode cryptochromes, proteins that influence circadian rhythms in other systems. Both genes cycled daily in the head of the squid, with a pattern similar to that of other animals, in which expression of certain cry genes is entrained by environmental light. In contrast, escry1 expression cycled in the symbiont-colonized light organ with 8-fold upregulation coincident with the rhythms of bacterial luminescence, which are offset from the day/night light regime. Colonization of the juvenile light organ by symbionts was required for induction of escry1 cycling. Further, analysis with a mutant strain defective in light production showed that symbiont luminescence is essential for cycling of escry1; this defect could be complemented by presentation of exogenous blue light. However, blue-light exposure alone did not induce cycling in nonsymbiotic animals, but addition of molecules of the symbiont cell envelope to light-exposed animals did recover significant cycling activity, showing that light acts in synergy with other symbiont features to induce cycling. While symbiont luminescence may be a character specific to rhythms of the squid-vibrio association, resident microbial partners could similarly influence well-documented daily rhythms in other systems, such as the mammalian gut. IMPORTANCE In mammals, biological rhythms of the intestinal epithelium and the associated mucosal immune system regulate such diverse processes as lipid trafficking and the immune response to pathogens. While these same processes are affected by the diverse resident microbiota, the extent to which these microbial communities control or are controlled by these rhythms has not been addressed. This study provides evidence that the presentation of three bacterial products (lipid A, peptidoglycan monomer, and blue light) is required for cyclic expression of a cryptochrome gene in the symbiotic organ. The finding that bacteria can directly influence the transcription of a gene encoding a protein implicated in the entrainment of circadian rhythms provides the first evidence for the role of bacterial symbionts in influencing, and perhaps driving, peripheral circadian oscillators in the host.

Abfrontal cilia and mucocytes were found in all species studied, with types and densities differing within and between gill types. The three species of homorhabdic filibranchs presented different densities of abfrontal cilia and mucocytes, from very dense in M. edulis to sparse in A. zebra. The heterorhabdic gills had intermediate cilia and mucocyte densities, with highest concentrations of both abfrontal cilia and mucocytes on the principal filaments. The eulamellibranchs showed low ciliary densities together with high mucocyte densities, especially in S. solidissima, where the abfrontal mucocytes were glandular. These results indicate that: (1) the abfrontal surface is a vestigial mucociliary surface; (2) the abfrontal surface cannot participate in water pumping in most species, due to low ciliary densities; and (3) species with high densities of abfrontal mucocytes could utilize abfrontal mucus to reduce drag, especially in the highly fused gills, such as those of the eulamellibranchs. The differing distributions of abfrontal cilia and mucocytes may reflect different selective pressures acting on the gills within the various taxa.",0.012688936,0.006772926,0.010684671,0.008776466,0.036634017,0.01459114,0.03898487,0.007104193,0.015192438,0.008335742,0.017577648,0.010866638,0.018063096,0.006932641,0.013973688,0.005800893,0.019338032,0.016189598,0.014536181,0.011691985,0.87580276,0.007285493,0.023669584,0.009757537,0.016276918,0.008796616,0.014595651,0.015273078,0.029896876,"['myzopoda aurita', 'bats', 'thyroptera', 'seal', 'myzopoda']","[0.0, 0.025974025974025, 0.012987012987012, 0.025974025974025, 0.012987012987012]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5]"

We found that FT messenger RNA is required only transiently in the leaf.

Beaver have well known effects on hydromorphology through dam construction, but their scope to restore wetland biodiversity in areas degraded by agriculture is largely inferred. Our study presents the first formal monitoring of a planned beaver-assisted restoration, focussing on changes in vegetation over 12years within an agriculturally-degraded fen following beaver release, based on repeated sampling of fixed plots. Effects are compared to ungrazed exclosures which allowed the wider influence of waterlogging to be separated from disturbance through tree felling and herbivory. After 12years of beaver presence mean plant species richness had increased on average by 46% per plot, whilst the cumulative number of species recorded increased on average by 148%. Heterogeneity, measured by dissimilarity of plot composition, increased on average by 71%. Plants associated with high moisture and light conditions increased significantly in coverage, whereas species indicative of high nitrogen decreased. Areas exposed to both grazing and waterlogging generally showed the most pronounced change in composition, with effects of grazing seemingly additive, but secondary, to those of waterlogging. Our study illustrates that a well-known ecosystem engineer, the beaver, can with time transform agricultural land into a comparatively species-rich and heterogeneous wetland environment, thus meeting common restoration objectives. This offers a passive but innovative solution to the problems of wetland habitat loss that complements the value of beavers for water or sediment storage and flow attenuation. The role of larger herbivores has been significantly overlooked in our understanding of freshwater ecosystem function; the use of such species may yet emerge as the missing ingredient in successful restoration.",0.15081485,0.00387894,0.08034311,0.006804153,0.004321634,0.003680586,0.002814715,0.004837862,0.014627535,0.003722295,0.009635199,0.008067557,0.007443506,0.005128853,0.005068321,0.005679126,0.002029297,0.002534328,0.019284908,0.006452671,0.003705728,0.005109335,0.007192702,0.011291885,0.003333954,0.002182216,0.002056513,0.004250813,0.00238266,"['plants', 'tobacco']","[0.027777777777777003, 0.013888888888888002]","[1.0, 0.5]"

Our predictions of body speed show good agreement with observations, demonstrating that snake propulsion on flat ground, and possibly in general, relies critically on the frictional anisotropy of their scales.

The slime originates as a two-component glandular exudate comprised of coiled bundles of cytoskeletal intermediate filaments (thread skeins) and mucin vesicles. Holocrine secretion of the slime into seawater results in the rapid deployment of both fibrous and mucin components, resulting in about a liter of dilute slime. Deployment of the thread skeins involves their unraveling in a fraction of a second from a 150 μm-long ellipsoid bundle to a thread that is 100× longer. We hypothesized that thread skein deployment requires both vigorous hydrodynamic mixing and the presence of mucin vesicles, both of which are required for whole slime deployment. Here we provide evidence that mixing and mucin vesicles are indeed crucial for skein unraveling. Specifically, we show that mucin vesicles mixed into seawater swell and elongate into high-aspect ratio mucin strands that attach to the thread skeins, transmit hydrodynamic forces to them and effect their unraveling by loading them in tension. Our discovery of mucin strands in hagfish slime not only provides a mechanism for the rapid deployment of thread skeins in vivo, it also helps explain how hagfish slime is able to trap such impressive volumes of seawater via viscous entrainment. We believe that the deployment of thread skeins via their interaction with shear-elongated mucins represents a unique mechanism in biology and may lead to novel technologies for transmitting hydrodynamic forces to microscale particles that would typically be immune to such forces.",0.019655261,0.016457027,0.8344775,0.012651379,0.029790929,0.033570338,0.013947688,0.028590405,0.93764573,0.012321062,0.01956231,0.031242965,0.021270843,0.006730033,0.022011576,0.015973596,0.016160574,0.012201533,0.013704416,0.024747364,0.018547384,0.014440175,0.030990282,0.043201976,0.009837735,0.012542558,0.008182154,0.017938912,0.01272967,"['bacteria', 'plants']","[0.029850746268656, 0.029850746268656]","[1.0, 1.0]"

We modeled the spatially inhomogeneous anisotropic elastic properties based on the measured compositional parameters and used the properties as inputs to a finite element model of the bone containing the foramen. This model, spatially constructed solely from the microscopic images, was subsequently validated by our mechanical test results. We found that: (1) a primary mechanism for stress concentration reduction appears to be due to an increased compliance near the foramen: the sharp discontinuity represented by the hole is softened by embedding it in a compliant region; (2) a reinforcing ring of increased stiffness exists at some distance from the foramen; and (3) a ring of lamellar bone exists along the foramen inside edge, which might serve to reduce the chance of cracks forming there.

During loop formation, the nematode bends the anterior half of its body until the head region makes contact with the side of the body. The two body regions are held fast by the surface tension of the water film covering the nematode. When the loop is contracted, the body becomes contorted so that the cuticle kinks. This extreme bending generates and stores sufficient energy that when the surface-tension force is broken the nematode is propelled through the air.

An important class of immune effector molecules to fight pathogen infections are antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that are produced in plants and animals. In Drosophila, the induction of AMPs in response to infection is regulated through the activation of the evolutionarily conserved Toll and immune deficiency (IMD) pathways. Here we show that AMP activation can be achieved independently of these immunoregulatory pathways by the transcription factor FOXO, a key regulator of stress resistance, metabolism and ageing. In non-infected animals, AMP genes are activated in response to nuclear FOXO activity when induced by starvation, using insulin signalling mutants, or by applying small molecule inhibitors. AMP induction is lost in foxo null mutants but enhanced when FOXO is overexpressed. Expression of AMP genes in response to FOXO activity can also be triggered in animals unable to respond to immune challenges due to defects in both the Toll and IMD pathways. Molecular experiments at the Drosomycin promoter indicate that FOXO directly binds to its regulatory region, thereby inducing its transcription. In vivo studies in Drosophila, but also studies in human lung, gut, kidney and skin cells indicate that a FOXO-dependent regulation of AMPs is evolutionarily conserved. Our results indicate a new mechanism of cross-regulation of metabolism and innate immunity by which AMP genes can be activated under normal physiological conditions in response to the oscillating energy status of cells and tissues. This regulation seems to be independent of the pathogen-responsive innate immunity pathways whose activation is often associated with tissue damage and repair. The sparse production of AMPs in epithelial tissues in response to FOXO may help modulating the defence reaction without harming the host tissues, in particular when animals are suffering from energy shortage or stress.",0.007660882,0.008310015,0.005351524,0.005464486,0.011408687,0.006967952,0.009497548,0.005580687,0.008129164,0.00967817,0.011429831,0.008137381,0.010230663,0.006368399,0.006722318,0.011298435,0.0075895,0.006811424,0.006147308,0.008491728,0.011124378,0.011749024,0.008640468,0.009287364,0.009888427,0.9405759,0.007293429,0.011697595,0.007603278,['larinioides cornutus'],[0.0],[0]

The major structural difference between the two secretions is the presence of specific proteins in the adhesive mucus. The present study identifies similar proteins from the glue of the slug Arion subfuscus and the land snail Helix aspersa. To investigate the role played by these proteins in adhesion, the proteins were isolated from the adhesive mucus of different molluscs and added to commercial polymer solutions. The effect was observed qualitatively, and quantified using a dynamic rheometer. The isolated proteins triggered gelling or visible stiffening of agar, pectin and polygalacturonic acid. The effect was stronger on more negatively charged polymers. The effect of the proteins was concentration dependent with an optimal concentration of 1–1.5 mg ml–1, and was weakened when their structure changed.

The functions of plant latex have been discussed for a long time. Today, many studies support a defence mechanism as being its main function. A role as a self-healing mechanism was never attributed to the coagulation of latex. In this study we quantified the contribution of the coagulation of Ficus benjamina (weeping fig) latex to a restoration of the mechanical properties of the bark after external lesions.


METHODS
Tensile tests of F. benjamina bark were conducted either immediately after injury or at various latency times after injury.


KEY RESULTS
A significant increase in the tensile strength of bark samples until 30 min after injury was found, and this effect could be attributed to the coagulation of plant latex alone. The tensile strength remains nearly constant until several hours or days after injury. Then, very probably due to other mechanisms such as cell growth and cell proliferation, the tensile strength begins to increase slightly again.


CONCLUSIONS
The coagulation of latex seals lesions and serves as a quick and effective pre-step of subsequent, more effective, long-lasting self-healing mechanisms such as cell growth and proliferation. Thus, a fast self-healing effect can be included in the list of functions of plant latex.",0.012484197,0.011920407,0.023474656,0.011413802,0.84802526,0.014105136,0.032975774,0.028505389,0.012874851,0.022060419,0.016304886,0.008763582,0.017714888,0.015396554,0.015716162,0.013653657,0.030906374,0.018166961,0.014873763,0.011839891,0.020035239,0.008703905,0.014048112,0.023921113,0.88168484,0.022799645,0.08977107,0.018920846,0.010343902,"['banana', 'mytilus galloprovincialis']","[0.018867924528301, 0.018867924528301]","[1.0, 1.0]"

We investigated the adhesive performance of 28 individuals and found that attachment performance on brass was not affected by the presence or absence of a seal around the pad–surface interface. Furthermore, on smooth acrylic, the wrist pads were more than nine-fold weaker when lifted perpendicular to the surface than when pulled parallel to it. The unimportance of a seal and the difference in strength in those directions on a smooth surface are characteristic of wet adhesion, but not of suction. Thus, despite its name, the sucker-footed bat appears to adhere using wet adhesion. We observed that when wrist pads were pushed anteriorly, they unpeeled easily from the surface because of deformation of the pads. This most likely permits rapid detachment during crawling, but would also cause passive detachment if bats roosted head-down. This provides an ecomorphological explanation to the head-up roosting behaviour of these unique bats. The results obtained in the present study thus link morphology, behaviour, and roosting ecology for an enigmatic Malagasy endemic. © 2009 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2010, 99, 233–240.

If shown to hold true, this technique could be used in larger-scale tomato production, protecting the crop and helping to introduce greater plant diversity into these agro-ecosystems. Here we present two large-scale glasshouse trials corresponding to the two main ways growers are likely to use marigolds to control whiteflies. In the first, marigolds are grown next to tomato throughout the growing period and we quantify whitefly population growth from the seedling stage over a 48 day infestation period. Here we show that association with marigolds significantly slows whitefly population development. Introducing additional whitefly-attractive ‘pull’ plants around the perimeter of plots has little effect, but reducing the proportion of marigolds and introducing other non-hosts of whiteflies (basil, nasturtium and Chinese cabbage) also reduces whitefly populations on tomato. The second experiment assesses the efficacy of marigolds when used as an ‘emergency’ measure. Here we allow whitefly populations to build to a high density on unprotected tomatoes then introduce marigolds and assess whitefly population over a further period. Following laboratory work showing limonene to be a major chemical component of French marigolds and a negative behaviour response of whiteflies to this compound, limonene dispensers are added as an additional treatment to this experiment. “Emergency” marigold companion planting yielded minimal reductions in whitefly performance, but the use of limonene dispensers was more effective. Our work indicates that companion planting short vine tomatoes with French marigolds throughout the growing season will slow development of whitefly populations. Introducing marigolds to unprotected tomatoes after significant whitefly build-up will be less effective. The use of limonene dispensers placed near to tomato plants also shows promise. It is argued that this work supports the possibility of the development of a mixture of tomato companion plants that infer ‘associational resistance’ against many major invertebrate pests of tomato. Such a mixture, if comprising edible or ornamental plants, would be economically viable, would reduce the need for additional chemical and biological control, and, if used outdoors, would generate plant-diverse agro-ecosystems that are better able to harbour invertebrate wildlife.",0.032052644,0.02707417,0.01529053,0.072482504,0.015294731,0.007732018,0.011326284,0.012626239,0.009967686,0.018519487,0.005410912,0.016810786,0.013089731,0.8905628,0.01160126,0.012990174,0.037271447,0.016566465,0.0343382,0.006915424,0.007424892,0.01678962,0.018117242,0.013470816,0.021760846,0.013476508,0.016386408,0.016962849,0.022670647,"['nepenthes rajah', 'tree shrews', 'nepenthes macrophylla', 'nepenthes burbidgeae', 'plants', 'shrews', 'tree shrew', 'nepenthes lowii']","[0.0, 0.0, 0.018518518518518, 0.018518518518518, 0.018518518518518, 0.055555555555555004, 0.018518518518518, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304, 1.0, 0.33333333333333304, 0.0]"

However, the extent to which any individual enzyme controls the rate of carbon fixation has been a long standing question. Over the last 10 years, antisense transgenic plants have been used as tools to address this and have revealed some unexpected findings about the Calvin cycle. It was shown that under a range of environmental conditions, the level of Rubisco protein had little impact on the control of carbon fixation. In addition, three of the four thioredoxin regulated enzymes, FBPase, PRKase and GAPDH, had negligible control of the cycle. Unexpectedly, non-regulated enzymes catalysing reversible reactions, aldolase and transketolase, both exerted significant control over carbon flux. Furthermore, under a range of growth conditions SBPase was shown to have a significant level of control over the Calvin cycle. These data led to the hypothesis that increasing the amounts of these enzymes may lead to an increase in photosynthetic carbon assimilation. Remarkably, photosynthetic capacity and growth were increased in tobacco plants expressing a bifunctional SBPase/FBPase enzyme.

This mechanism relies on the energy, of order 100 eV, needed to reduce entropy and increase enthalpy as molecular segments are stretched after being released by the breaking of weak bonds, called sacrificial bonds. This energy is relatively large compared to the energy needed to break the polymer backbone, of order a few eV. In many biological cases, the breaking of sacrificial bonds has been found to be reversible, thereby additionally providing a ""self-healing"" property to the material. Due to the nanoscopic nature of this mechanism, single molecule force spectroscopy using an atomic force microscope has been a useful tool to investigate this mechanism. Especially when investigating natural molecular constructs, force versus distance curves quickly become very complicated. In this work we propose various types of sacrificial bonds, their combination, and how they appear in single molecule force spectroscopy measurements.

This review focuses on phytoremediation with particular interest on the interactions between and use of plant-associated bacteria to restore PHC polluted sites. Plant-associated bacteria include endophytic, phyllospheric, and rhizospheric bacteria, and cooperation between these bacteria and their host plants allows for greater plant survivability and treatment outcomes in contaminated sites. Bacterially driven PHC bioremediation is attributed to the presence of diverse suites of metabolic genes for aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, along with a broader suite of physiological properties including biosurfactant production, biofilm formation, chemotaxis to hydrocarbons, and flexibility in cell-surface hydrophobicity. In soils impacted by PHC contamination, microbial bioremediation generally relies on the addition of high-energy electron acceptors (e.g., oxygen) and fertilization to supply limiting nutrients (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium) in the face of excess PHC carbon. As an alternative, the addition of plants can greatly improve bioremediation rates and outcomes as plants provide microbial habitats, improve soil porosity (thereby increasing mass transfer of substrates and electron acceptors), and exchange limiting nutrients with their microbial counterparts. In return, plant-associated microorganisms improve plant growth by reducing soil toxicity through contaminant removal, producing plant growth promoting metabolites, liberating sequestered plant nutrients from soil, fixing nitrogen, and more generally establishing the foundations of soil nutrient cycling. In a practical and applied sense, the collective action of plants and their associated microorganisms is advantageous for remediation of PHC contaminated soil in terms of overall cost and success rates for in situ implementation in a diversity of environments. Mechanistically, there remain biological unknowns that present challenges for applying bio- and phyto-remediation technologies without having a deep prior understanding of individual target sites. In this review, evidence from traditional and modern omics technologies is discussed to provide a framework for plant–microbe interactions during PHC remediation. The potential for integrating multiple molecular and computational techniques to evaluate linkages between microbial communities, plant communities and ecosystem processes is explored with an eye on improving phytoremediation of PHC contaminated sites.",0.010628873,0.009512018,0.011695039,0.013178069,0.007437171,0.007871801,0.006911868,0.01662592,0.011946957,0.009723148,0.019943459,0.007378908,0.89239407,0.010186654,0.011313509,0.005206772,0.009632706,0.010104084,0.008784937,0.01228619,0.008458726,0.009438804,0.00972979,0.008718965,0.012808505,0.016202195,0.009873327,0.008743847,0.00911464,[],[],[]

It is shown that green leaves minimize absorption of useful radiation and allow efficient infrared thermal emission. Since elevated temperatures are detrimental for tensile water flow in the Xylem tissue below barks, the optical properties of barks should also have evolved so as to avoid excessive heating. This was tested by performing optical studies with tree bark samples from representative trees. It was found that tree barks have optimized their reflection of incoming sunlight between 0.7 and 2 μm. This is approximately the optical window in which solar light is transmitted and reflected by green vegetation. Simultaneously, the tree bark is highly absorbing and thus radiation emitting between 6 and 10 μm.

A review of recent literature identifies likely scent sources, potential scent transport processes, and research needs. Scent sources include gases in bubbles or dissolved in the water, liquids as buoyant plumes and droplets or dissolved in the water, and solids consisting of buoyant particulates with secretions, bacteria, and body fluids. Potential transport processes through the water include buoyancy, entrainment, and turbulence.

Here we uncover the physical basis of the material design of nuclear lamina that enables it to withstand extreme mechanical deformation of >100% strain despite the presence of structural defects. Through a simple in silico model we demonstrate that this is due to nanoscale mechanisms including protein unfolding, alpha-to-beta transition, and sliding, resulting in a characteristic nonlinear force-extension curve. At the larger microscale this leads to an extreme delocalization of mechanical energy dissipation, preventing catastrophic crack propagation. Yet, when catastrophic failure occurs under extreme loading, individual protein filaments are sacrificed rather than the entire meshwork. This mechanism is theoretically explained by a characteristic change of the tangent stress-strain hardening exponent under increasing strain. Our results elucidate the large extensibility of the nuclear lamina within muscle or skin tissue and potentially many other protein materials that are exposed to extreme mechanical conditions, and provide a new paradigm toward the de novo design of protein materials by engineering the nonlinear stress-strain response to facilitate flaw-tolerant behavior.",0.03306853,0.03852799,0.030394942,0.015756259,0.9001837,0.034030847,0.8633739,0.02874827,0.023822019,0.024240758,0.031364433,0.016368387,0.042557888,0.025629878,0.07378458,0.038531154,0.0591658,0.037151076,0.029549988,0.023459513,0.73117524,0.034044236,0.04485071,0.041897044,0.096203335,0.030149698,0.6654339,0.039334413,0.062476866,"['cubitermes', 'insects', 'termites', 'earthworm', 'earthworms', 'blowflies']","[0.034090909090909005, 0.011363636363636001, 0.034090909090909005, 0.011363636363636001, 0.011363636363636001, 0.011363636363636001]","[1.0, 0.33333333333333304, 1.0, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304]"

These data were collected using a combination of a high-contrast CytoViva imaging system and a particle image velocimetry camera, which can capture images at speeds greater than 800 frames/s. Using this system, we discovered that, during rapid swimming of Giardia trophozoites, undulations of the caudal region contributed to forward propulsion combined with the beating of the flagella pairs. It was also discovered, in contrast to previous studies with 10 times slower image sampling technique, that the anterior and posterolateral flagella beat with a clearly defined power stroke and not symmetrical undulations. During the transition from free swimming to attachment, trophozoites modified their swimming behavior from a rapid rotating motion to a more stable planar swimming. While using this planar swimming motion, the trophozoites used the flagella for propulsion and directional control. In addition to examination of the posterolateral and anterior flagella, a model to describe the motion of the ventral flagella was derived, indicating that the ventral flagella beat in an expanding sine wave. In addition, the structure of the ventrocaudal groove creates boundary conditions that determine the form of beating of the ventral flagella.

Each droplet is formed of a central mass of viscoelastic glycoprotein glue surrounded by an aqueous covering, both of which incorporate hydrophilic components. We found that the extensibility of droplets on Larinioides cornutus threads increased as humidity increased. However, the deflection of the droplets' supporting axial lines did not change, indicating that atmospheric water uptake increases glycoprotein plasticity, but not glycoprotein adhesion. The extensibility of droplets, along with that of the thread's supporting axial fibers, is responsible for summing the adhesion of multiple thread droplets.

Our results showed that free fatty acids, cholesterol, and ceramides were the major constituents of SC in larks from different environments including the Netherlands, a mesic environment; Iran, a semiarid region; and several areas in Saudi Arabia, a hot dry desert. We found that CWL was reduced among larks inhabiting deserts, but our data did not support the hypothesis that birds from desert environments have larger quantities of lipids per unit dry mass of the SC than larks from more mesic environments. Instead, larks in arid environments had a higher proportion of ceramides, especially the more polar fractions 4–6, and a smaller proportion of free fatty acids in their SC, an adjustment that apparently reduced their CWL. Subtle changes in the ratios of lipid classes can apparently alter the movement of water vapor through the skin. We hypothesize that desert birds have higher proportions of ceramides in their SC and lower proportions of free fatty acids because this combination allows the lipid lamellae to exist in a more highly ordered crystalline phase and consequently creates a tighter barrier to water‐vapor diffusion.",0.011302713,0.0058788,0.012076491,0.003230192,0.01493202,0.004401439,0.025263658,0.006867146,0.02421037,0.00685059,0.017888177,0.016027283,0.007188562,0.007046011,0.013205132,0.88979954,0.006288019,0.009020681,0.012450955,0.010806963,0.006330929,0.00921778,0.04858312,0.01765446,0.011462582,0.018914191,0.007045154,0.033002872,0.012694553,"['vertebrates', 'lullula arborea', 'alauda arvensis', 'alaemon alaudipes', 'eremalauda dunni', 'larks']","[0.0125, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.125]","[0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]"

To date, the perceived ecological role for toxins has been relief from grazing pressures. Here, we demonstrate that karlotoxins also serve as a predation instrument. Using high-speed holographic microscopy, we measure the swimming behavior of several toxic and nontoxic strains of K. veneficum and their prey, Storeatula major, within dense suspensions. The selected strains produce toxins with varying potency and dosages, including a nontoxic one. Results clearly show that mixing the prey with the predatory, toxic strains causes prey immobilization at rates that are consistent with the karlotoxins’ potency and dosage. Even prey cells that continue swimming slow down after exposure to toxic predators. The swimming characteristics of predators vary substantially in pure suspensions, as quantified by their velocity, radii of helical trajectories, and direction of helical rotation. When mixed with prey, all toxic strains that are involved in predation slow down. Furthermore, they substantially reduced their predominantly vertical migration, presumably to remain in the vicinity of their prey. Conversely, the nontoxic control strain does not alter its swimming and does not affect prey behavior. In separate experiments, we show that exposing prey to exogenous toxins also causes prey immobilization at rates consistent with potency. Clearly, the toxic predatory strains use karlotoxins as a means of stunning their prey, before ingesting it.

The main elements that contribute to the overall attachment force, however, remained unknown. Multiple local force–volume measurements were performed on individual terminal plates by using atomic force microscopy.

Local adhesion was approximately twice as strong in the centre of the plate as on its border. Adhesion of fly footprints on a glass surface, recorded within 20 min after preparation, was similar to adhesion in the centre of a single attachment pad. Adhesion strongly decreased with decreasing volume of footprint fluid, indicating that the layer of pad secretion covering the terminal plates is crucial for the generation of a strong attractive force.

Structural color is commonly observed in the animal kingdom, but has been little studied in plants. We present a striking example of multilayer-based strong iridescent coloration in plants, in the fruit of Pollia condensata. The color is caused by Bragg reflection of helicoidally stacked cellulose microfibrils that form multilayers in the cell walls of the epicarp. We demonstrate that animals and plants have convergently evolved multilayer-based photonic structures to generate colors using entirely distinct materials. The bright blue coloration of this fruit is more intense than that of any previously described biological material. Uniquely in nature, the reflected color differs from cell to cell, as the layer thicknesses in the multilayer stack vary, giving the fruit a striking pixelated or pointillist appearance. Because the multilayers form with both helicoidicities, optical characterization reveals that the reflected light from every epidermal cell is polarized circularly either to the left or to the right, a feature that has never previously been observed in a single tissue.",0.016222151,0.015005139,0.00734019,0.007580164,0.01677785,0.009524951,0.005141984,0.011579552,0.0152515,0.02233491,0.009247169,0.009135197,0.015839487,0.010512696,0.011648881,0.009033908,0.009021,0.8866673,0.012894301,0.017224057,0.015611109,0.01157644,0.013723669,0.013441324,0.012108203,0.014052351,0.011243363,0.015874395,0.009337981,['plants'],[0.034090909090909005],[1.0]

We use a phylogenomic approach—ultraconserved element sequence capture—to investigate the evolutionary history of an iconic multispecies mutualism: Neotropical acacia ants (Pseudomyrmex ferrugineus group) and their associated Vachellia hostplants. In this system, the ants receive shelter and food from the host plant, and they aggressively defend the plant against herbivores and competing plants. We confirm the existence of two separate lineages of obligate acacia ants that convergently occupied Vachellia and evolved plant-protecting behaviour, from timid ancestors inhabiting dead twigs in rainforest. The more diverse of the two clades is inferred to have arisen in the Late Miocene in northern Mesoamerica, and subsequently expanded its range throughout much of Central America. The other lineage is estimated to have originated in southern Mesoamerica about 3 Myr later, apparently piggy-backing on the pre-existing mutualism. Initiation of the Pseudomyrmex/Vachellia interaction involved a shift in the ants from closed to open habitats, into an environment with more intense plant herbivory.

Those from sheltered localities, which are broad, bullate blades, experience greater drag at a given water velocity than ones from localities more exposed to the action of waves, which have smooth, deeply dissected blades. All specimens rearranged their blades as water velocity increased, resulting in a decrease in effective drag at higher water speeds, but individuals with smooth, dissected blades assumed a more compact shape at high current speeds and thus reduced their effective drag over that of broad-bladed individuals at the same speed.

The drying of the capsule results in the storage of elastic energy in the capsule valves. The failure of the seam joining the two values precipitates the conversion of the elastic potential energy stored in the valves and seeds. In the hygrochastic case the failure is due to moisture absorption on wetting of the capsule beak which weakens the pectic “glue”; in the xerochastic case the seam failure is due simply to the high stress in the bonding layer at some degree of desiccation. This paper explains quantitatively how the anatomy of the capsule efficiently imports high initial expulsion velocity to the seeds in order to maximize their range.

Using thermal infrared cameras, we identified hot spots along the flanks of free-ranging Brazilian free-tailed bats, ventral to the extended wings. These hot spots are absent in syntopic cave myotis (Myotis velifer), a species that forages over relatively short distances, and does not engage in long-distance migration. We hypothesized that the hot spots, or ""radiators,"" on Brazilian free-tailed bats may be adaptations for migration, particularly in this long-distance, high-flying species. We examined the vasculature of radiators on Brazilian free-tailed bats with transillumination to characterize the unique arrangements of arteries and veins that are positioned perpendicular to the body in the proximal region of the wing. We hypothesized that these radiators aid in maintaining heat balance by flushing the uninsulated thermal window with warm blood, thereby dissipating heat while bats are flying under warm conditions, but shunting blood away and conserving heat when they are flying in cooler air at high altitudes. We also examined fluid-preserved specimens representing 122 species from 15 of 18 chiropteran families and radiators appeared present only in species in the family Molossidae, including both sedentary and migratory species and subspecies. Thus, the radiator appears to be a unique trait that may facilitate energy balance and water balance during sustained dispersal, foraging, and long-distance migration.",0.008585761,0.012851764,0.007483591,0.004606659,0.009064923,0.010957438,0.008203716,0.006020739,0.007737318,0.007269674,0.010428603,0.005609143,0.007185075,0.005142306,0.004010528,0.015844632,0.00606079,0.007271343,0.005773556,0.007539373,0.008228919,0.00645612,0.9393373,0.003971981,0.008285265,0.008240504,0.006187962,0.007891719,0.012129497,['plants'],[0.016129032258064002],[1.0]

Here, we provided direct evidence for an effective mineralization of nitrogenous soil organic matter in the gut of Cubitermes spp., which gives rise to enormous ammonia concentrations in the intestinal tract. In Cubitermes ugandensis, the ammonia content of the nest material [24.5 μmol (g dry wt.)−1] was about 300-fold higher than that of the parent soil. Large amounts of ammonia were present throughout the intestinal tract, with lowest values in the extremely alkaline gut sections (pH >12) and highest values posterior hindgut [185 μmol (g dry wt.)−1]. Results obtained with other Cubitermes species were similar. Ammonia concentrations in the posterior hindgut of these humivorous species (up to 130 mM) are among the highest values ever reported for soil macroinvertebrates and are matched only by insects feeding on an extremely protein-rich diet (e.g., the sarcophageous larvae of blowflies). Volatilization of ammonia [about 10 nmol (g fresh wt.)−1 h−1], either directly by emission from the termite body or indirectly from their feces, led to NH3 concentrations in the nest atmosphere of C. ugandensis that were three orders of magnitude above the ambient background – a relative accumulation that is considerably higher than that observed with CH4 and CO2. Together with previous results, these observations document that through their feeding activity and due to the physicochemical and biochemical properties of their digestive system, soil-feeding termites effectively catalyze the transformation of refractory soil organic nitrogen to a plant-available form that is protected from leaching by adsorption to the nest soil.

To maintain cellular water homeostasis, natural selection modified the integument of pioneering terrestrial animals, enabling them to reduce water loss through the skin. In desert environments, where ambient temperatures (Ta) can reach 50°C, relative humidities are low and drinking water is scarce, integumentary modifications that reduce cutaneous water loss (CWL) could be fundamental to survival. Previous research has shown that hoopoe larks (Alaemon alaudipes) from the Arabian desert reduced CWL when acclimated to 35°C compared with individuals at 15°C, but skylarks (Alauda arvensis) and woodlarks (Lullula arborea), from The Netherlands, and Dunn's larks (Eremalauda dunni), also from the Arabian desert, did not. Here, we test the idea that hoopoe larks acclimated to 35°C would alter the lipid composition of their stratum corneum (SC), resulting in a decrease in CWL, but that skylarks, woodlarks and Dunn's larks would not. Specifically, we hypothesized that hoopoe larks, acclimated to 35°C, would increase the proportions of polar ceramide content and decrease the proportions of free fatty acids in their SC compared with individuals acclimated to 15°C. Results showed that hoopoe larks at 35°C had lower CWL and higher proportions of total ceramides but lower proportions of free fatty acids and sterols in their SC. We demonstrate that adjustments in ratios of lipid classes in the SC are associated with changes in CWL in hoopoe larks.",0.010998218,0.006004939,0.012598247,0.003420494,0.014118033,0.003849934,0.032226276,0.006803748,0.023624375,0.00710739,0.019017627,0.016644664,0.008424585,0.007123948,0.012956915,0.8960118,0.005646685,0.009845793,0.011567987,0.010891765,0.006745213,0.008835788,0.053053066,0.015038483,0.011300337,0.02044958,0.006330452,0.03398895,0.01328024,['aphids'],[0.034482758620689],[1.0]

Additional experiments with culture broth devoid of cells showed that anaerobic decolourisation of azo dyes was performed by extracellular reducing agents produced by anaerobic bacteria. This was further confirmed by abiotic experiments with sulphide and NADH. The presence of redox mediators such as riboflavin led to dramatic acceleration of the anaerobic biodecolourisation process.

Canopy plasticity, the expression of different leaf phenotypes within the crown of an individual tree has complex functional and evolutionary implications that remain to be thoroughly assessed. We hypothesized that it can lead to disparity in how leaves in different positions of the canopy change with allometric growth and population genetic structure. 
2. Leaf phenotypes of the inner and outer canopy were estimated using eight morphological and physiological characters. All traits were measured under field conditions in six populations of Olea europaea and again in a common garden for a subset of the genotypes. The same populations were characterized genetically with amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) genomic scans. With these data, we investigated the extent to which leaf phenotypes change with plant size, genetic processes and in response to environmental conditions inside and outside the canopy. 
3. The size of trees measured in the field was clearly associated with the phenotype of sun but not to that of shade leaves. The phenotype of sun leaves depended on both direct and diffuse light, while that of shade leaves was found to correlate only with diffuse radiation. Additionally, light availability inside the canopy was conditioned by the shape of external leaves, and increasing elongation of sun leaves led to higher radiation in the inner canopy. 
4. The field phenotypes of both inner and outer canopy leaves were correlated with genetic variation among populations. Conversely, in the common garden, the different genotypes expressed a homogeneous sun phenotype, while phenotypic differences among populations remained apparent in shade leaves. 
5. We conclude that, in agreement with our working hypothesis, canopy plasticity is both cause and consequence of the environment experienced by the plant and might lead to the differential expression of genetic polymorphisms among leaves. Furthermore, we propose that it can contribute to buffer abiotic stress and to the partition of light use within the tree crown.",0.005462766,0.007277625,0.026307486,0.005974403,0.012296842,0.016262785,0.007265518,0.007616714,0.923486,0.006704092,0.008601529,0.017740496,0.010383702,0.004764371,0.01281234,0.015654556,0.009116802,0.011818226,0.006319675,0.014401619,0.008114344,0.009629986,0.018910794,0.013296635,0.004225165,0.009667829,0.00676668,0.011585414,0.006557337,"['calopteryx splendens', 'sympetrum sanguineum']","[0.015873015873015, 0.015873015873015]","[1.0, 1.0]"

Protection of the newly synthesized cuticle from molting fluid enzymes has long been attributed to the presence of an impermeable envelope layer that was thought to serve as a physical barrier, preventing molting fluid enzymes from accessing the new cuticle and thereby ensuring selective degradation of only the old one. In this study, using the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, as a model insect species, we show that an entirely different and unexpected mechanism accounts for the selective action of chitinases and possibly other molting enzymes. The molting fluid enzyme chitinase, which degrades the matrix polysaccharide chitin, is not excluded from the newly synthesized cuticle as previously assumed. Instead, the new cuticle is protected from chitinase action by the T. castaneum Knickkopf (TcKnk) protein. TcKnk colocalizes with chitin in the new cuticle and organizes it into laminae. Down-regulation of TcKnk results in chitinase-dependent loss of chitin, severe molting defects, and lethality at all developmental stages. The conservation of Knickkopf across insect, crustacean, and nematode taxa suggests that its critical roles in the laminar ordering and protection of exoskeletal chitin may be common to all chitinous invertebrates.",0.01947923,0.00565821,0.011063382,0.025278904,0.017060975,0.012638682,0.008656719,0.014895529,0.014464933,0.009532111,0.9017066,0.01484628,0.03940495,0.00658627,0.013905752,0.024008404,0.005782423,0.010272198,0.017726209,0.013906431,0.023560138,0.011148182,0.043015998,0.020910189,0.011907019,0.019572569,0.009211594,0.011669273,0.005918785,"['hummingbirds', 'insects', 'birds', 'rufous hummingbird', 'selasphorus rufus', 'trochilidae']","[0.064935064935064, 0.064935064935064, 0.077922077922077, 0.0, 0.0, 0.012987012987012]","[0.833333333333333, 0.833333333333333, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.16666666666666602]"

This spicule is composed of concentrically arranged lamellae that are approximately 10 μm thick. In the present study, we investigated the formation of outer lamellae on a cellular level using microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. It is shown that the formation of an outermost lamella begins with the association of cell clusters with the surface of the thickening and/or growing spicule. The cells release silica for controlled formation of a lamella. The pericellular (silica) material fuses to a delimited and textured layer of silica with depressions approximately 20–30 μm in diameter. The newly formed layer initially displays 40 μm wide, well-structured banded ribbons and only attains its plain surface in a final step. The chemical composition in the depressions was studied using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and by staining with Texas Red. The data suggest that those depressions are the nests for the silica-forming cells and that silica formation starts with a direct association of silica-forming cells with the outer surface of the spicule, where they remain and initiate the development of the next lamellae.",0.01023757,0.006873624,0.027795695,0.007413095,0.011082869,0.018306147,0.008101692,0.021674167,0.013753415,0.013386663,0.013746108,0.016961457,0.011207009,0.010618351,0.030273711,0.014930246,0.008262669,0.011225857,0.005093831,0.015968395,0.008546775,0.010863266,0.008239939,0.8964974,0.018690586,0.007639065,0.006902691,0.011628526,0.012875034,"['baleen whales', 'whale', 'whales', 'megaptera novaeangliae', 'humpback whale', 'humpback']","[0.0, 0.041095890410958, 0.027397260273972, 0.0, 0.027397260273972, 0.027397260273972]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.6666666666666661, 0.0, 0.6666666666666661, 0.6666666666666661]"

In many species, far-red (FR) light is known to accelerate flowering. This is environmentally significant because leaves absorb more red light than FR light; thus, plants growing under a canopy experience light that is enriched in FR light. In this article, we have explored the promotion of flowering by FR-enriched light (FREL) in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Previous work has shown that the floral promoter CONSTANS (CO) plays a critical role in day-length perception and exhibits complex regulation; CO mRNA is regulated by the circadian clock and CO protein is stabilized by light and degraded in darkness. We find that plants grown under FREL contain higher levels of CO mRNA in the early part of the day than plants under white light. Furthermore, transgenic plants expressing CO under the control of a constitutive promoter accumulate higher levels of CO protein under FREL, indicating that FREL can increase CO protein levels independently of transcription. Consistent with the model that FREL promotes flowering through CO, mutants for co or gigantea, which are required for CO transcript accumulation, are relatively insensitive to FREL. Because the red:FR ratios used in these experiments are in the range of what plants would experience under a canopy, these results indicate that the regulation of CO by light quality likely plays a key role in the regulation of flowering time in natural environments.",0.061129775,0.76361233,0.022293257,0.8358186,0.021573493,0.029180465,0.02659317,0.03552269,0.013050858,0.034396663,0.016621953,0.042188406,0.03885348,0.84784013,0.03158095,0.013330721,0.03997621,0.03536997,0.047406983,0.017819706,0.024011048,0.05506886,0.060533468,0.02097943,0.034394454,0.031563688,0.027510101,0.040294237,0.042441454,"['rice', 'fish', 'misgurnus', 'misgurnus anguillicaudatus', 'weather loach', 'fishes']","[0.009523809523809, 0.038095238095238, 0.009523809523809, 0.009523809523809, 0.009523809523809, 0.019047619047619]","[0.25, 1.0, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.5]"

The striking force of the jet at the impact is such to overcome the strong anchoring forces of insects. The origin of the effectiveness of such hunting mechanism has been long searched for inside of the fish, in the unsuccessful attempt to identify internal structures dedicated to the amplification of muscular power. Here we perform a kinematic analysis of the jet emitted by two specimens of Toxotes jaculatrix. We estimate that at the impact the jet conveys a typical specific power of about 3000 W/kg, which is well above the maximum specific power of the order of 500 W/kg deliverable by a vertebrate muscle. Unexpectedly, we find that the amplification of muscular power occurs outside of the fish, and is due to a hydrodynamic instability of the jet akin to those occurring in Drop-on-Demand inkjet printing. The investigated fish are found to modulate the velocity of the jet at the orifice to favor the formation of a single, large, water drop that hits the prey abruptly with a large momentum. The observed mechanism represents a remarkable example of use of an external hydrodynamic lever that does possibly not entail the high evolutionary cost needed for the development of highly specialized internal structures dedicated to the storing of mechanical energy.",0.91990167,0.00798911,0.014942831,0.011144734,0.00739384,0.008406274,0.005855199,0.003556549,0.003798495,0.01256786,0.010735527,0.008154613,0.00920192,0.014004621,0.007460856,0.008839778,0.005257352,0.011324154,0.02107408,0.017959127,0.009367291,0.006929566,0.013515578,0.006317866,0.007616275,0.006038417,0.005878544,0.010804247,0.011478353,"['plants', 'palms']","[0.081081081081081, 0.027027027027027]","[1.0, 0.33333333333333304]"

Recent progress on the biochemistry and mechanics of sclerotized structures from non-arthropod invertebrates such as mussels, polychaetes and squid suggests that this premise is too simple and needs to be more closely scrutinized. Emerging mechanistic insights about structure–property relationships in sclerotized extracellular composites include the following: (1) tissue stiffness can be significantly adjusted by the relative organization and density of rigid versus flexible domains in the protein components (mussel byssal thread); (2) structures can be rich in polyphenols without being sclerotized (mussel adhesive plaque); (3) stiffness and hardness can be adjusted by the relative abundance of interactions between protein-based imidazole and catecholate ligands and transition metals (polychaete jaws and mussel cuticle); (4) polyphenol-derived covalent cross-link density in a protein–chitin composite offers some stiffening, but gains from incrementally controlled dehydration are far greater (squid beak); and finally, (5) protein domains, ligand and metal densities, covalent cross-linking and dehydration are elaborately manipulated to create stiffness gradients between mechanically mismatched tissues.",0.011240522,0.006785017,0.0101898,0.0102167,0.023439884,0.015675314,0.019645322,0.007727732,0.013914497,0.008826777,0.015860174,0.0097949,0.019401819,0.007403266,0.013007414,0.003748411,0.017833816,0.016029336,0.015369757,0.008183725,0.8400344,0.007254566,0.022625392,0.009349851,0.012962478,0.008924301,0.010950438,0.010651923,0.027616367,"['plants', 'nereocystis luetkeana', 'sea urchin']","[0.09090909090909001, 0.045454545454545005, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.5, 0.0]"

In Arabidopsis, this response (shade avoidance syndrome, SAS) is controlled by phytochromes (particularly phyB), and is dependent on the TAA1 pathway of auxin biosynthesis. However, when grown in real canopies, we found that phyB mutants and mutants deficient in TAAI (sav3) still display robust SAS responses to increased planting density and leaf shading. The SAS morphology (leaf hyponasty and reduced lamina/petiole ratio) could be phenocopied by exposing plants to blue light attenuation. These responses to blue light attenuation required the UV-A/blue light photoreceptor cry1. Moreover, they were mediated through mechanisms that showed only limited overlap with the pathways recruited by phyB inactivation. In particular, pathways for polar auxin transport, auxin biosynthesis and gibberellin signaling that are involved in SAS responses to low R:FR were not required for the SAS responses to blue light depletion. By contrast, the brassinosteroid response appeared to be required for the full expression of the SAS phenotype under low blue light. The phyB and cry1 inactivation pathways appeared to converge in their requirement for the basic/helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORs 4 and 5 (PIF4 and PIF5) to elicit the SAS phenotype.

Subsequent heat transfer analysis shows that habitat wind speed and shading conditions also affect face temperature gradients such as the rate of eastern face temperature change. It is then demonstrated that the geographic variation in mean mound orientation follows the geographic variation in long-term wind speed and shading conditions across northern Australia such that an eastern face temperature plateau is maintained in all locations.,0.050138626,0.028066058,0.82667077,0.014119333,0.021053199,0.019493151,0.029480036,0.035516277,0.05681541,0.01629478,0.030267036,0.021037675,0.021962496,0.013664604,0.009480495,0.029691564,0.027060118,0.014977728,0.012681208,0.028107675,0.021707557,0.016825238,0.86347073,0.05189046,0.020356787,0.010497073,0.006926558,0.020318415,0.04211646,"['poecile gambeli', 'northern goshawk', 'accipiter striatus', 'bird', 'accipiter', 'gnoma', 'birds', 'poecile rufescens', 'northern pygmy-owl', 'poecile atricapillus', 'sharp-shinned hawk', 'accipiter gentilis', 'glaucidium', 'black-capped chickadee', 'glaucidium gnoma', 'goshawk', 'poecile']","[0.014285714285714, 0.0, 0.014285714285714, 0.028571428571428, 0.028571428571428, 0.014285714285714, 0.028571428571428, 0.014285714285714, 0.0, 0.014285714285714, 0.0, 0.014285714285714, 0.014285714285714, 0.0, 0.014285714285714, 0.028571428571428, 0.042857142857142004]","[0.33333333333333304, 0.0, 0.33333333333333304, 0.6666666666666661, 0.6666666666666661, 0.33333333333333304, 0.6666666666666661, 0.33333333333333304, 0.0, 0.33333333333333304, 0.0, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304, 0.0, 0.33333333333333304, 0.6666666666666661, 1.0]"

We examine their apparently paradoxical property, facilitation of efficient permeation of water while excluding protons, which is of critical importance to preserving the electrochemical potential across the cell membrane. We have determined the structure of the Escherichia coliaquaglyceroporin GlpF with bound water, in native (2.7 angstroms) and in W48F/F200T mutant (2.1 angstroms) forms, and carried out 12-nanosecond molecular dynamics simulations that define the spatial and temporal probability distribution and orientation of a single file of seven to nine water molecules inside the channel. Two conserved asparagines force a central water molecule to serve strictly as a hydrogen bond donor to its neighboring water molecules. Assisted by the electrostatic potential generated by two half-membrane spanning loops, this dictates opposite orientations of water molecules in the two halves of the channel, and thus prevents the formation of a “proton wire,” while permitting rapid water diffusion. Both simulations and observations revealed a more regular distribution of channel water and an increased water permeability for the W48F/F200T mutant.",0.9215733,0.007125611,0.018554647,0.017204156,0.006792505,0.009498864,0.006338261,0.004033663,0.003218769,0.012940003,0.011317669,0.007830153,0.008920397,0.014542677,0.00648203,0.010588013,0.004867572,0.010403811,0.01830365,0.015166347,0.008077905,0.008227522,0.012000604,0.008328312,0.007936545,0.005715806,0.005536446,0.010457074,0.011019077,['beetles'],[0.12],[1.0]

Many parts of the insect exoskeleton, such as the jumping legs of locusts, have to withstand high and repeated loading without failure. This paper presents the first measurements of fracture toughness for insect cuticle using a standard engineering approach. Our results show that the fracture toughness of cuticle in locust hind legs is 4.12 MPa m1/2 and decreases with desiccation of the cuticle. Stiffness and strength of the tibia cuticle were measured using buckling and cantilever bending and increased with desiccation. A combination of the cuticle’s high toughness with a relatively low stiffness of 3.05 GPa results in a work of fracture of 5.56 kJ m–2, which is amongst the highest of any biological material, giving the insect leg an exceptional ability to tolerate defects such as cracks and damage. Interestingly, insect cuticle achieves these unique properties without using reinforcement by a mineral phase, which is often found in other biological composite materials. These findings thus might inspire the development of new biomimetic composite materials.",0.02146399,0.033287793,0.05546162,0.02592967,0.9302225,0.059427425,0.10362779,0.031280894,0.031370495,0.036715437,0.051252022,0.017859584,0.05278761,0.03947219,0.053151373,0.025882978,0.07133292,0.04011995,0.03493955,0.026734555,0.64250433,0.03078513,0.03894056,0.03652232,0.94106656,0.027618654,0.9016208,0.06974546,0.042643618,"['bird', 'birds', 'penguins', 'emperor penguin', 'aptenodytes', 'aptenodytes forsteri']","[0.04918032786885201, 0.04918032786885201, 0.032786885245901, 0.032786885245901, 0.016393442622950002, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.6666666666666661, 0.6666666666666661, 0.33333333333333304, 0.0]"

Modifications to the composite profile of the rostral cuticle that simultaneously enhance the flexibility and toughness of the distal portion of the snout are characterized. Using classical laminate plate theory, the effect of these modifications on the elastic behavior of the exoskeleton is estimated. It is shown that the tensile behavior of the rostrum across six Curculio species with high morphological variation correlates with changes in the relative layer thicknesses and orientation angles of layers in the exoskeleton. Accordingly, increased endocuticle thickness is strongly correlated with increased tensile strength. Rostrum stiffness is shown to be inversely correlated with work of fracture; thus allowing a highly curved rostrum to completely straighten without structural damage. Finally, exocuticle rich invaginations of the occipital sutures are identified both as a likely site of crack initiation in tensile failure and as a source of morphological constraint on the evolution of the rostrum in Curculio weevils. It is concluded that avoidance of catastrophic structural failure, as initiated in these sutures under tension, is the driving selective pressure in the evolution of the female Curculio rostrum.",0.004964685,0.006434428,0.015901221,0.00469469,0.9115915,0.00746436,0.019816784,0.014835119,0.012000095,0.010502963,0.009091135,0.003902085,0.008328627,0.007848727,0.01617648,0.01007626,0.010940129,0.007531895,0.009500366,0.004239407,0.0188847,0.00622909,0.004856775,0.010221913,0.24555354,0.012444454,0.28126183,0.014878585,0.009437136,['metazoans'],[0.019607843137254003],[1.0]

For endoparasitic species that develop inside another (host) species, mortality of the host may directly induce mortality risk for the parasite. Thus, endoparasitoid larvae should be selected for response to host predation. In this study, aphids previously parasitized by the endoparasitoid Endaphis fugitiva, Gagné and Muratori (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), were experimentally exposed to increased mortality risks. Both simulated attack and actual predator attacks against aphid hosts induced early emergence of the parasitoid larvae. Parasitoid emergence from the aphids occurred several minutes before the predator finished feeding on the aphid, allowing enough time for the parasitoid larvae to avoid direct predation. Predator-induced emergence produced significantly smaller parasitoid larvae than controls, but, interestingly, no effect on Endaphis adult size was found. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of induced emergence in an insect parasitoid, but we suggest that this mechanism might be at work in many other species where plasticity in development time allows the individual to perform an adaptive niche shift.",0.014519346,0.01804406,0.006456705,0.76111746,0.004278335,0.012318956,0.005330994,0.008869989,0.007090349,0.022634763,0.024407193,0.023036439,0.023801353,0.055869102,0.015119597,0.004610797,0.00511809,0.009784875,0.008752216,0.008816179,0.013794158,0.047145016,0.015642056,0.013495858,0.011906801,0.009022578,0.006595337,0.015778266,0.01608931,"['petaluridae', 'zygoptera', 'gomphidae', 'arthropods', 'odonata']","[0.016129032258064002, 0.016129032258064002, 0.016129032258064002, 0.016129032258064002, 0.032258064516129004]","[0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0]"

Collenchyma has remained in the shadow of commercially exploited mechanical tissues such as wood and fibres, and therefore has received little attention since it was first described. However, collenchyma is highly dynamic, especially compared with sclerenchyma. It is the main supporting tissue of growing organs with walls thickening during and after elongation. In older organs, collenchyma may become more rigid due to changes in cell wall composition or may undergo sclerification through lignification of newly deposited cell wall material. While much is known about the systematic and organographic distribution of collenchyma, there is rather less information regarding the molecular architecture and properties of its cell walls.


SCOPE AND CONCLUSIONS
This review summarizes several aspects that have not previously been extensively discussed including the origin of the term 'collenchyma' and the history of its typology. As the cell walls of collenchyma largely determine the dynamic characteristics of this tissue, I summarize the current state of knowledge regarding their structure and molecular composition. Unfortunately, to date, detailed studies specifically focusing on collenchyma cell walls have not been undertaken. However, generating a more detailed understanding of the structural and compositional modifications associated with the transition from plastic to elastic collenchyma cell wall properties is likely to provide significant insights into how specific configurations of cell wall polymers result in specific functional properties. This approach, focusing on architecture and functional properties, is likely to provide improved clarity on the controversial definition of collenchyma.",0.007597815,0.003995118,0.011807266,0.002702888,0.9109238,0.006331447,0.022982636,0.02090417,0.012695647,0.010218787,0.006988507,0.004092899,0.005288707,0.004996175,0.009150494,0.01015108,0.006591389,0.006558825,0.011136618,0.003592874,0.016826168,0.004323495,0.010925748,0.005986609,0.019475004,0.01064491,0.022114795,0.007628718,0.007331734,['bacillus subtilis'],[0.014925373134328],[1.0]

The kinematic symmetry of the hummingbird upstroke and downstroke has led to the assumption that these halves of the wingbeat cycle contribute equally to weight support during hovering, as exhibited by insects of similar size. This assumption has been applied, either explicitly or implicitly, in widely used aerodynamic models and in a variety of empirical tests. Here we provide measurements of the wake of hovering rufous hummingbirds (Selasphorus rufus) obtained with digital particle image velocimetry that show force asymmetry: hummingbirds produce 75% of their weight support during the downstroke and only 25% during the upstroke. Some of this asymmetry is probably due to inversion of their cambered wings during upstroke. The wake of hummingbird wings also reveals evidence of leading-edge vortices created during the downstroke, indicating that they may operate at Reynolds numbers sufficiently low to exploit a key mechanism typical of insect hovering. Hummingbird hovering approaches that of insects, yet remains distinct because of effects resulting from an inherently dissimilar—avian—body plan.",0.01049895,0.01325113,0.016231941,0.009837419,0.020487789,0.025650209,0.017283468,0.006977354,0.013449964,0.008916485,0.005068227,0.008545874,0.013388471,0.020677771,0.008689904,0.006133853,0.86583054,0.011377226,0.011398613,0.021256968,0.017909424,0.01710021,0.020679602,0.012523431,0.00940427,0.011206491,0.007927161,0.007699533,0.020006025,"['fish', 'arapaima', 'arapaima gigas']","[0.017543859649122, 0.017543859649122, 0.017543859649122]","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0]"

Humpback whales utilize extremely mobile, wing-like flippers for banking and turning. Large rounded tubercles along the leading edge of the flipper are morphological structures that are unique in nature. The tubercles on the leading edge act as passive-flow control devices that improve performance and maneuverability of the flipper. Experimental analysis of finite wing models has demonstrated that the presence of tubercles produces a delay in the angle of attack until stall, thereby increasing maximum lift and decreasing drag. Possible fluid-dynamic mechanisms for improved performance include delay of stall through generation of a vortex and modification of the boundary layer, and increase in effective span by reduction of both spanwise flow and strength of the tip vortex. The tubercles provide a bio-inspired design that has commercial viability for wing-like structures. Control of passive flow has the advantages of eliminating complex, costly, high-maintenance, and heavy control mechanisms, while improving performance for lifting bodies in air and water.

Unlike most macroalgae, Postelsia stands upright in air- like trees. The stipe flexibility that permits Postelsia to withstand waves is provided by the low elastic modulus (5-10 MPa) of stipe tissue; in spite of the weakness (low breaking stress, ~ 1 MPa) of this tissue, a large amount of energy ( ~ 100 kJ/m 3) is required to break a stipe because they can be extended by 20-25 % before breaking. Although made of such easily deformed tissue, Postelsia can stand upright in air due to the width (high second moment of area) and resilience of their stipes, but the brittleness (low work of fracture, 400-900 J/m 2) that accompanies this resilience renders them susceptible to bre~age if they sustain deep scratches. Although wave-induced stresses experienced by individuals in aggregations are not lower than those experienced by isolated sea-palms, photon flux densities of photosynthetically active radiation within these dense groves are less than 10% of those above Postelsia canopies.

Much less is known about how birds discriminate between the calls of different species of predators. We played back the calls of three species of raptors to black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus, mountain chickadees, Poecile gambeli, and chestnut-backed chickadees, Poecile rufescens, to determine whether they can discriminate between them using acoustic cues. We played the calls of two species of small, high-threat raptors, northern pygmy-owl, Glaucidium gnoma, and sharp-shinned hawk, Accipiter striatus, which have very different hunting strategies (mainly sit-and-wait ambush predator versus very fast surprise attack flights). We also played a larger, lower-threat northern goshawk, Accipiter gentilis. Black-capped and mountain chickadees responded much more to the calls of the two small, more dangerous raptors than to the northern goshawk; they also responded very differently to the calls of the two small raptors.

Shells such as conch (Strombus gigas), giant clam (Tridacna gigas), and red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) have hierarchical architectures that differ depending on growth requirements and shell formation of the particular mollusk. Mechanical tests have been carried out on these shells for a comparison of strength with respect to the microstructural architecture and sample orientation. The mechanical response is found to vary significantly from specimen to specimen and requires the application of Weibull statistics in order to be quantitatively evaluated. The complex micro-laminate structure of these biocomposite materials is characterized and related to their mechanical properties. The red abalone has the highest compressive (233–540 MPa) and flexure strengths of the three shells. The giant clam has the lowest strength (87–123 MPa) and the conch has an intermediate value (166–218 MPa) in compression. The high compressive strength observed in the abalone is attributed to an optimization of microstructural architecture in the form of 2-D laminates, enhancing the fracture toughness of this shell material and enabling higher stresses to develop before fracture.

Alkaliphiles include prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and archaea. Many different taxa are represented among the alkaliphiles, and some of these have been proposed as new taxa. Alkaliphiles can be isolated from normal environments such as garden soil, although viable counts of alkaliphiles are higher in samples from alkaline environments. The cell surface may play a key role in keeping the intracellular pH value in the range between 7 and 8.5, allowing alkaliphiles to thrive in alkaline environments, although adaptation mechanisms have not yet been clarified. Alkaliphiles have made a great impact in industrial applications. Biological detergents contain alkaline enzymes, such as alkaline cellulases and/or alkaline proteases, that have been produced from alkaliphiles. The current proportion of total world enzyme production destined for the laundry detergent market exceeds 60%. Another important application is the industrial production of cyclodextrin by alkaline cyclomaltodextrin glucanotransferase. This enzyme has reduced the production cost and paved the way for cyclodextrin use in large quantities in foodstuffs, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. It has also been reported that alkali-treated wood pulp could be biologically bleached by xylanases produced by alkaliphiles. Other applications of various aspects of alkaliphiles are also discussed.",0.010852682,0.009991703,0.012483626,0.013670838,0.008170302,0.008616936,0.008104337,0.015679521,0.011344213,0.012679059,0.022565803,0.007852259,0.91292137,0.009901995,0.013918273,0.00677393,0.011104672,0.010854796,0.009984174,0.014105129,0.009143924,0.009990354,0.012576864,0.008513831,0.014667602,0.018567137,0.010981075,0.011857444,0.011236892,['legionella pneumophila'],[0.015625],[1.0]

ENaC function also regulates extracellular fluid volume as water flows across membranes accompanying Na+ ions to maintain osmolarity. To examine the sites of expression and intracellular localization of ENaC, we generated polyclonal antibodies against the extracellular domain of human α-ENaC subunit that we expressed in E. coli. Three-dimensional (3D) confocal microscopy of immunofluorescence using these antibodies for the first time revealed that ENaCs are uniformly distributed on the ciliary surface in all epithelial cells with motile cilia lining the bronchus in human lung and female reproductive tract, all along the fimbrial end of the fallopian tube, the ampulla and rare cells in the uterine glands. Quantitative analysis indicated that cilia increase cell surface area >70-fold and the amount of ENaC on cilia is >1,000-fold higher than on non-ciliated cell surface. These findings indicate that ENaC functions as a regulator of the osmolarity of the periciliary fluid bathing the cilia. In contrast to ENaC, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) that channels chloride ions from the cytoplasm to the lumen is located mainly on the apical side, but not on cilia. The cilial localization of ENaC requires reevaluation of the mechanisms of action of CFTR and other modulators of ENaC function.

They are involved in many physiological roles, including membrane remodeling, chemotaxis, touch, and pain [1-3], but, the mechanism by which their transmembrane (TM) domains transmit temperature signals is largely unknown. The histidine kinase DesK from Bacillus subtilis is the paradigmatic example of a membrane-bound thermosensor suited to remodel membrane fluidity when the temperature drops below approximately 30°C [1, 4] providing, thus, a tractable system for investigating the mechanism of TM-mediated input-output control of thermal adaptation. Here we show that the multimembrane-spanning domain from DesK can be simplified into a chimerical single-membrane-spanning minimal sensor (MS) that fully retains, in vivo and in vitro, the sensing properties of the parental system. The MS N terminus contains three hydrophilic amino acids near the lipid-water interface creating an instability hot spot. Mutational analysis of this boundary-sensitive beacon revealed that membrane thickness controls the signaling state of the sensor by dictating the hydration level of the metastable hydrophilic spot. Guided by these results we biochemically demonstrated that the MS signal transmission activity is sensitive to bilayer thickness. Membrane thickness could be a general cue for sensing temperature in many organisms.",0.006497288,0.01597068,0.00643498,0.008540159,0.010211782,0.014251201,0.007456962,0.005519567,0.009527192,0.010488355,0.010787977,0.005235741,0.006746025,0.00580914,0.005450826,0.010101395,0.0066855,0.008512494,0.005099175,0.006811579,0.008660113,0.008555653,0.9195631,0.004111085,0.007258891,0.006928197,0.005893473,0.007404966,0.007976943,"['amphibians', 'amniotes', 'tetrapods']","[0.019607843137254003, 0.019607843137254003, 0.07843137254901901]","[0.25, 0.25, 1.0]"

Others, more recently, have asked the same question. Fortunately, similar doubt did not afflict Darwin. A review of the evolutionary evidence reveals ample evidence that eyes can and do evolve. For example, there are creatures that have multiple and very specific eyes, suggesting that eyes are not only rather easy to evolve, but, in some creatures, ocular evolution can be quite rapid.

The process of organism photoreception probably started shortly after life began on this planet, stimulated by the sun. Ocular evolution responded to the sun's energy by producing phototaxis leading to crude eye spots, then ascending to the complex and elegant ocular structure of certain birds having two foveae and asymmetric lenses for precise focusing. Fantastic adaptations, often beyond imagination, have occurred and are with us today, including irregularly shaped eyes and special photopigments to view ultraviolet, infrared, and bioluminescence. The extension of the interpretation of electromagnetic waves into realms we cannot understand must create a fantastic panoply of colours and stimulations. And, yet, as ophthalmologists, we rarely consider that any visual system is significantly better than or even that different from our own. This is folly for many species have evolved spectacular and stunning adaptations to the visual imperatives of their world.

The crepuscular aerial drama of a swallow on the wing hunting for a small erratic insect illustrates the profoundly complex visual processing necessary to provide identification, tracking, pursuit, and eventual capture in a dimly lit and almost clueless three dimensional environment.

Ants are good models for studying recognition mechanisms, because they are typically very efficient in discriminating ‘friends’ (nest-mates) from ‘foes’ (non-nest-mates). Recognition in ants involves multicomponent cues encoded in cuticular hydrocarbon profiles. Here, we tested whether workers of the carpenter ant Camponotus herculeanus use the presence and/or absence of cuticular hydrocarbons to discriminate between nest-mates and non-nest-mates. We supplemented the cuticular profile with synthetic hydrocarbons mixed to liquid food and then assessed behavioural responses using two different bioassays. Our results show that (i) the presence, but not the absence, of an additional hydrocarbon elicited aggression and that (ii) among the three classes of hydrocarbons tested (unbranched, mono-methylated and dimethylated alkanes; for mono-methylated alkanes, we present a new synthetic pathway), only the dimethylated alkane was effective in eliciting aggression. Our results suggest that carpenter ants use a fundamentally different mechanism for nest-mate recognition than previously thought. They do not specifically recognize nest-mates, but rather recognize and reject non-nest-mates bearing odour cues that are novel to their own colony cuticular hydrocarbon profile. This begs for a reappraisal of the mechanisms underlying recognition systems in social insects.",0.024755178,0.04373548,0.01311424,0.8736954,0.006877146,0.017827645,0.010799387,0.017045366,0.014941091,0.034291033,0.031979717,0.04096738,0.03513051,0.073274724,0.018583564,0.010262469,0.019575372,0.025555741,0.020006167,0.017233497,0.017462894,0.8337106,0.030380351,0.012969898,0.014655058,0.021220764,0.010643358,0.015620888,0.018438634,"['tree shrews', 'tupaia montana', 'plants', 'montana', 'shrews', 'tree shrew', 'nepenthes lowii']","[0.0, 0.0, 0.013333333333333001, 0.026666666666666002, 0.026666666666666002, 0.013333333333333001, 0.0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0]"

So far, bacteriorhodopsins capable of generating a chemiosmotic membrane potential in response to light have been demonstrated only in halophilic archaea. We describe here a type of rhodopsin derived from bacteria that was discovered through genomic analyses of naturally occuring marine bacterioplankton. The bacterial rhodopsin was encoded in the genome of an uncultivated gamma-proteobacterium and shared highest amino acid sequence similarity with archaeal rhodopsins. The protein was functionally expressed in Escherichia coli and bound retinal to form an active, light-driven proton pump. The new rhodopsin exhibited a photochemical reaction cycle with intermediates and kinetics characteristic of archaeal proton-pumping rhodopsins. Our results demonstrate that archaeal-like rhodopsins are broadly distributed among different taxa, including members of the domain Bacteria.

Like most holothurians it feeds on benthic sediments. Feeding is episodic and after collecting food on the bottom it returns to the water column at altitudes within about 50 m of the sea floor. Direct observations from submersibles and laboratory studies of living specimens have shown how bioluminescence is produced. Light production in E. eximia is triggered mechanically, and is produced by hundreds of granular bodies within the gelatinous integument of the animal. Local stimulation yields a localized response which gradually spreads to the entire surface of the animal. Broad impact yields a whole-body luminescent response. The integument of E. eximia is quite fragile, and strong physical contact readily causes the skin to be sloughed off in a glowing cloud. The degree of luminous response is a function of the severity of contact. In the laboratory the skin of E. eximia , along with its luminescent capability, regenerated rapidly. The anti-predatory role of bioluminescence in this species is apparently a ‘burglar alarm’ strategy.

In order to discriminate between infectious agents and self, macrophages have evolved a restricted number of phagocytic receptors, like the mannose receptor, that recognize conserved motifs on pathogens. Pathogens are also phagocytosed by complement receptors after relatively nonspecific opsonization with complement and by Fc receptors after specific opsonization with antibodies. All these receptors induce rearrangements in the actin cytoskeleton that lead to the internalization of the particle. However, important differences in the molecular mechanisms underlying phagocytosis by different receptors are now being appreciated. These include differences in the cytoskeletal elements that mediate ingestion, differences in vacuole maturation, and differences in inflammatory responses. Infectious agents, such as M. tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, and Salmonella typhimurium, enter macrophages via heterogeneous pathways and modify vacuolar maturation in a manner that favors their survival. Macrophages also play an important role in the recognition and clearance of apoptotic cells; a notable feature of this process is the absence of an inflammatory response.",0.007058503,0.00769686,0.005147519,0.005819055,0.011978908,0.006655148,0.008711735,0.006657843,0.008261704,0.010278353,0.011463095,0.010401888,0.011418807,0.006141299,0.008041392,0.010344269,0.006801769,0.00691885,0.006293632,0.008043438,0.010999852,0.011153492,0.007166469,0.009898784,0.009727714,0.93820727,0.006685662,0.011677397,0.007235799,"['sea urchins', 'echinoderms', 'sea urchin']","[0.014925373134328, 0.014925373134328, 0.014925373134328]","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0]"

Human IGF1 mutations cause profound deafness, poor growth and mental retardation. Accordingly, Igf1−/− null mice are dwarfs that have low survival rates, cochlear alterations and severe sensorineural deafness. Presbycusis (age-related hearing loss) is a common disorder associated with aging that causes social and cognitive problems. Aging is also associated with a decrease in circulating IGF-I levels and this reduction has been related to cognitive and brain alterations, although there is no information as yet regarding the relationship between presbycusis and IGF-I biodisponibility. Here we present a longitudinal study of wild type Igf1+/+ and null Igf1−/− mice from 2 to 12 months of age comparing the temporal progression of several parameters: hearing, brain morphology, cochlear cytoarchitecture, insulin-related factors and IGF gene expression and IGF-I serum levels. Complementary invasive and non-invasive techniques were used, including auditory brainstem-evoked response (ABR) recordings and in vivo MRI brain imaging. Igf1−/− null mice presented profound deafness at all the ages studied, without any obvious worsening of hearing parameters with aging. Igf1+/+ wild type mice suffered significant age-related hearing loss, their auditory thresholds and peak I latencies augmenting as they aged, in parallel with a decrease in the circulating levels of IGF-I. Accordingly, there was an age-related spiral ganglion degeneration in wild type mice that was not evident in the Igf1 null mice. However, the Igf1−/− null mice in turn developed a prematurely aged stria vascularis reminiscent of the diabetic strial phenotype. Our data indicate that IGF-I is required for the correct development and maintenance of hearing, supporting the idea that IGF-I-based therapies could contribute to prevent or ameliorate age-related hearing loss.",0.005731485,0.008951828,0.046398606,0.006453851,0.01922956,0.021129347,0.011140714,0.008245899,0.9549417,0.008264639,0.009998508,0.029715862,0.009905651,0.003869161,0.014200067,0.021543393,0.00958634,0.013665753,0.006768513,0.01976714,0.012622672,0.012067108,0.018065562,0.019395523,0.004851877,0.011146399,0.006971598,0.014170274,0.011219015,['barnacles'],[0.039215686274509005],[1.0]

For the ranges of various environmental factors considered in a sensitivity analysis, the average surface temperature of the stem was most influenced by air temper? ature. Greater diurnal extremes of stem temperature occurred at lower wind velocities. Asymmetrical heating of the stem by direct solar irradiation was clearly evident in the measurements and the simulations. The model was used to study the effect of changes in spine coverage, apical pubescence, stem absorptance, tissue thermal properties, plant height, and diameter on stem surface temperatures. In the absence of spines the average surface temperature of Mammillaria became 1 to 2?C cooler at night and 2 to 6?C warmer during the day. The effect of spines on the simulated diurnal temperature variation was even greater for the apical meristem, which had the most dense coverage of spines. A mat of pubescence additionally protected the apical meristem of Carnegiea and Ferocactus acan- thodes, substantially reducing diurnal temperature extremes there. Simulated decreases in the di? ameter of Carnegiea increased the daily range of temperatures of the apical meristem, suggesting that some adaptive optimization of plant diameter may have occurred.

This fluid is an emulsion, consisting of watery droplets in an oily continuous phase. The detailed function of its two-phasic nature has remained unclear. Here we show that the pad emulsion provides a mechanism that prevents insects from slipping on smooth substrates. We discovered that it is possible to manipulate the adhesive secretion in vivo using smooth polyimide substrates that selectively absorb its watery component. While thick layers of polyimide spin-coated onto glass removed all visible hydrophilic droplets, thin coatings left the emulsion in its typical form. Force measurements of stick insect pads sliding on these substrates demonstrated that the reduction of the watery phase resulted in a significant decrease in friction forces. Artificial control pads made of polydimethylsiloxane showed no difference when tested on the same substrates, confirming that the effect is caused by the insects’ fluid-based adhesive system. Our findings suggest that insect adhesive pads use emulsions with non-Newtonian properties, which may have been optimized by natural selection.

Explaining their maintenance is problematic, because cheaters should outcompete cooperative conspecifics, leading to mutualism instability. Monoecious figs (Ficus) are pollinated by host-specific wasps (Agaonidae), whose larvae gall ovules in their “fruits” (syconia). Female pollinating wasps oviposit directly into Ficus ovules from inside the receptive syconium. Across Ficus species, there is a widely documented segregation of pollinator galls in inner ovules and seeds in outer ovules. This pattern suggests that wasps avoid, or are prevented from ovipositing into, outer ovules, and this results in mutualism stability. However, the mechanisms preventing wasps from exploiting outer ovules remain unknown. We report that in Ficus rubiginosa, offspring in outer ovules are vulnerable to attack by parasitic wasps that oviposit from outside the syconium. Parasitism risk decreases towards the centre of the syconium, where inner ovules provide enemy-free space for pollinator offspring. We suggest that the resulting gradient in offspring viability is likely to contribute to selection on pollinators to avoid outer ovules, and by forcing wasps to focus on a subset of ovules, reduces their galling rates. This previously unidentified mechanism may therefore contribute to mutualism persistence independent of additional factors that invoke plant defences against pollinator oviposition, or physiological constraints on pollinators that prevent oviposition in all available ovules.",0.07678128,0.008070591,0.006646179,0.07949167,0.003708895,0.003481134,0.004593979,0.006995344,0.006764995,0.039159145,0.00731531,0.04581323,0.004123113,0.24782641,0.012231421,0.016664,0.007450132,0.01643929,0.09832885,0.008965659,0.003388078,0.033482496,0.005297672,0.019137705,0.007838174,0.010599257,0.007669289,0.06543995,0.006066374,"['amphibians', 'insects', 'turtles', 'frogs']","[0.013698630136986, 0.013698630136986, 0.013698630136986, 0.013698630136986]","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]"

Unlike the condition in modern reptiles, which experience hypercapnia when submerged in water, these animals would have experienced hypercapnia on land, owing to likely inefficient means of eliminating carbon dioxide. The different patterns of dermal bone sculpture in these tetrapods largely correlates with levels of terrestriality: sculpture is reduced or lost in stem amniotes that likely had the more efficient lung ventilation mode of costal aspiration, and in small-sized stem amphibians that would have been able to use the skin for gas exchange.",0.003913721,0.002763293,0.020226898,0.001694034,0.018881466,0.004775388,0.00749233,0.007548523,0.070786916,0.002537559,0.004587486,0.00531412,0.004554062,0.001492258,0.00306594,0.071507856,0.003517286,0.003966951,0.00408409,0.003299086,0.00666954,0.003097756,0.044864707,0.006499209,0.003835995,0.003929326,0.002724002,0.009987964,0.014516583,"['strongylocentrotus droebachiensis', 'green sea urchin', 'sea urchin']","[0.02, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

Many antibiotics are sourced from specialized metabolites produced by bacteria, particularly those of the Actinomycetes family 2 . Although actinomycete extracts have traditionally been screened using activity-based platforms, this approach has become unfavourable owing to the frequent rediscovery of known compounds. Genome sequencing of actinomycetes reveals an untapped reservoir of biosynthetic gene clusters, but prioritization is required to predict which gene clusters may yield promising new chemical matter 2 . Here we make use of the phylogeny of biosynthetic genes along with the lack of known resistance determinants to predict divergent members of the glycopeptide family of antibiotics that are likely to possess new biological activities. Using these predictions, we uncovered two members of a new functional class of glycopeptide antibiotics—the known glycopeptide antibiotic complestatin and a newly discovered compound we call corbomycin—that have a novel mode of action. We show that by binding to peptidoglycan, complestatin and corbomycin block the action of autolysins—essential peptidoglycan hydrolases that are required for remodelling of the cell wall during growth. Corbomycin and complestatin have low levels of resistance development and are effective in reducing bacterial burden in a mouse model of skin MRSA infection.

Tree shrews (Tupaia montana) feed on exudates produced by glands on the inner surfaces of the pitcher lids and defecate into the pitchers. *Here, we tested the hypothesis that pitcher geometry in these species is related to tree shrew body size by comparing the pitcher characteristics with those of five other 'typical' (arthropod-trapping) Nepenthes species. *We found that only pitchers with large orifices and lids that are concave, elongated and oriented approximately at right angles to the orifice capture faeces. The distance from the tree shrews' food source (that is, the lid nectar glands) to the front of the pitcher orifice precisely matches the head plus body length of T. montana in the faeces-trapping species, and is a function of orifice size and the angle of lid reflexion. *Substantial changes to nutrient acquisition strategies in carnivorous plants may occur through simple modifications to trap geometry.

Correlations among these parameters were examined in order to determine the influence of self-shading, and the regulation of standing leaf numbers, on leaf longevity and its association with leaf photosynthetic capacity. Leaf longevity and the number of leaves on the main shoot were both reduced in high light, while in the low light environment, they were reduced in the steeper self-shading gradient. In high nutrients, leaf longevity was reduced whereas leaf number increased. Leaf initiation rates were higher in the high nutrient treatment but were not influenced by either light treatment. Maximum-light saturated photosynthetic rate, on an area basis, was greater in the high light and nutrient treatments, while the decline in photosynthetic capacity in realtion to leaf position on the shoot was more rapid in high light and in low nutrients. Leaf longevity was negatively correlated among treatments with initial photosynthetic capacity. The leaf position at which photosynthetic capacity was predicted to reach zero was positively correlated with the number of leaves on the shoot, supporting the hypothesis that leaf numbers are regulated by patterns of self-shading. The negative association of longevity and initial photosynthetic capacity apparently arises from different associations among gradients of photosynthetic capacity, leaf numbers and leaf initiation rates in relation to light and nutrient availability.

However, virtually all previous experiments have used one or more techniques (surrogates for males and females, and short sampling duration) that bypassed two potentially important aspects of echinoid reproductive biology: the release of gametes in viscous fluids that cling to tests and spines, and extended longevity of eggs and undiluted sperm. We hypothesized that these attributes might interact with some flow regimes to facilitate time-integrated fertilization. Consequently, we explored fertilization processes in sea urchins induced to spawn in a benthic boundary layer in a flow-through flume, with a male 0.5 m upstream of a female. Our observations and data suggest that at free‐stream flow velocities of 2.5 and 8.5 cm s 21 , gametes were slowly and continually advected from the aboral surfaces of spawning animals. Eggs on the surface of the aboral mass were often fertilized before they ablated from the surface; many advected eggs were fertilized after being trapped in the vortex downstream of the female. Gamete advection and fertilization continued for several hours, with the actual time course depending on flow velocity. Fertilization levels declined only slightly with increasing flow velocity. These results suggest that fertilization in echinoderms and other free-spawners with viscous, long-lived gametes could be much less sperm-limited than currently envisioned and have additional implications for population dynamics and selection on gamete characteristics.",0.0842023,0.01687124,0.020911882,0.028252395,0.020032711,0.028538778,0.011624903,0.06681768,0.04857918,0.88334787,0.0239614,0.83579874,0.01930354,0.0465754,0.040199272,0.031351246,0.015628545,0.042910077,0.7587781,0.02867069,0.029448083,0.04866883,0.016628385,0.0652896,0.037017062,0.0325237,0.027437743,0.052446518,0.041394025,"['arachnocampa', 'arachnocampa flava', 'glowworms']","[0.012195121951219001, 0.0, 0.036585365853658]","[0.33333333333333304, 0.0, 1.0]"

Survival of such excursions depends on either freeze avoidance through supercooling or freeze tolerance. Supercooling, a metastable state in which body fluids remain liquid below the equilibrium freezing/melting point, is promoted by physiological responses that protect against chilling injury and by anatomical and behavioral traits that limit risk of inoculative freezing by environmental ice and ice-nucleating agents. Freeze tolerance evolved from responses to fundamental stresses to permit survival of the freezing of a substantial amount of body water under thermal and temporal conditions of ecological relevance. Survival of freezing is promoted by a complex suite of molecular, biochemical and physiological responses that limit cell death from excessive shrinkage, damage to macromolecules and membranes, metabolic perturbation and oxidative stress. Although freeze avoidance and freeze tolerance generally are mutually exclusive strategies, a few species can switch between them, the mode used in a particular instance of chilling depending on prevailing physiological and environmental conditions.",0.0077544,0.011976746,0.006448613,0.004522228,0.009696665,0.009879744,0.008732637,0.005152058,0.009024351,0.006234266,0.010706387,0.005690767,0.006647064,0.005194977,0.003159914,0.012757374,0.006492098,0.007494752,0.006061399,0.00734154,0.010360136,0.006723406,0.93575984,0.003236666,0.008920915,0.008200439,0.006487886,0.008152203,0.011813043,['plants'],[0.043956043956043],[1.0]

Leg tendons save energy in this way when birds and mammals run, and an aponeurosis in the back is also important in galloping mammals. Tendons may have similar energy-saving roles in other modes of locomotion, for example in cetacean swimming.

Freeze-tolerant animals typically endure the conversion of 50% or more of total body water into extracellular ice and employ a suite of adaptations that counter the negative consequences of freezing. Specific adaptations control the sites and rate of ice formation to prevent physical damage by ice. Other adaptations regulate cell-volume change: Colligative cryoprotectants minimize cell shrinkage during extracellular ice formation; other protectants stabilize membrane structure; and a high density of membrane transporter proteins ensure rapid cryoprotectant distribution. Cell survival during freezing is also potentiated by anoxia tolerance, mechanisms of metabolic rate depression, and antioxidant defenses. The net result of these protective mechanisms is the ability to reactivate vital functions after days or weeks of continuous freezing. Magnetic resonance imaging has allowed visual examinations of the mode of ice penetration through the body of freeze-tolerant frogs and turtles, and cryomicroscopy has illustrated the effects of freezing on the cellular and microvasculature structure of tissues.

However, to date, there is no experimental evidence demonstrating that peroxidase affects the mechanical properties of skin tissue. Here, the mechanical properties of skin strips excised from a range of fruits at different ages were determined using an 'Instron' universal material testing instrument. The stiffness of tomato fruit skin strips increases 3-fold with increasing fruit age. Application of partially-purified peroxidase from the cell walls of mature tomato fruit skin significantly increased the stiffness of fruit skin irrespective of the age of fruit. Furthermore, the application of hydrogen peroxide significantly increased the stiffness of skin strips excised from fruit of an age when endogenous peroxidase isozymes associated with the termination of growth are first detected. The results support the hypothesis that the tomato fruit skin plays an integral role in the regulation of tomato fruit growth, and that changes in its mechanical properties may be mediated by peroxidase.

Here we use an unbiased transcriptional profiling approach to identify TRPA1 channels as infrared receptors on sensory nerve fibres that innervate the pit organ. TRPA1 orthologues from pit-bearing snakes (vipers, pythons and boas) are the most heat-sensitive vertebrate ion channels thus far identified, consistent with their role as primary transducers of infrared stimuli. Thus, snakes detect infrared signals through a mechanism involving radiant heating of the pit organ, rather than photochemical transduction.

Two species of the echinoid genus Echinometra were tested for spatial vision by examining their ability to locate and move towards targets of different sizes. The echinoids were significantly oriented (P<0.0001) towards a target with an angular width of 33° (0.3 sr) but were not oriented to targets with angular widths of 26° and 16°. This ability is probably due to the blocking of off-angle light by the spines, which have approximately the correct spacing for the observed resolution. Spatial vision is advantageous for echinoids of this genus because they leave and return to small dark shelters.

From measurements of the wetland inflow and outflow, we observed a consistent decrease in nitrate (by 10% of inflow concentrations), while ammonium increased by an order of magnitude. Outflow ammonium concentrations oscillated in a diel cycle, inverse to the concentration of dissolved oxygen (i.e., greater ammonium export at night). The pulsed 15N additions showed little uptake of nitrate over time in the wetland and rapid daytime uptake of ammonium from the water column (rate constant, kt 5 0.11 h21). A steady-state 15Nammonium addition demonstrated a similar rate of ammonium uptake (kt 5 0.067 h21), no detectable nitrification, and highlighted the spatial pattern of ammonium and nitrate uptake within the wetland. Porewater concentration profiles suggest high rates of net ammonium diffusion from the sediments. Ecosystem metabolism measurements indicate that release was attenuated during the day by autotrophic uptake, resulting in lower ammonium export during the day. Denitrification rates were modeled from dissolved N2 : Ar ratios, but they were not sufficient to account for the observed loss in nitrate.

Using structural and biochemical approaches, we show that the thermosensitive histidine kinase, DesK, from Bacillus subtilis is cold-activated through specific interhelical rearrangements in its central four-helix bundle domain. As revealed by the crystal structures of DesK in different functional states, the plasticity of this helical domain influences the catalytic activities of the protein, either by modifying the mobility of the ATP-binding domains for autokinase activity or by modulating binding of the cognate response regulator to sustain the phosphotransferase and phosphatase activities. The structural and biochemical data suggest a model in which the transmembrane sensor domain of DesK promotes these structural changes through conformational signals transmitted by the membrane-connecting two-helical coiled-coil, ultimately controlling the alternation between output autokinase and phosphatase activities. The structural comparison of the different DesK variants indicates that incoming signals can take the form of helix rotations and asymmetric helical bends similar to those reported for other sensing systems, suggesting that a similar switching mechanism could be operational in a wide range of sensor histidine kinases.",0.005061197,0.011169395,0.006326853,0.00738085,0.009951605,0.009962793,0.006722569,0.006059966,0.01067715,0.009655022,0.011524781,0.005584626,0.007085273,0.004936058,0.005357232,0.010131603,0.005719252,0.007156837,0.004507194,0.005719903,0.007659399,0.008983064,0.8856538,0.004372092,0.006218183,0.006606487,0.00455716,0.007248754,0.007234873,"['insects', 'honeybee']","[0.025, 0.025]","[1.0, 1.0]"

The teeth can be subdivided into a cusp, a junctional area where the cusp is joined to the base, and the base which is embedded in the radular membrane. From a study of longitudinal vertical and transverse sections of the mature teeth it was found that the cusp could be subdivided into a posterior iron-rich area (44–51% Fe, 1–6% Si) and an anterior silicon-rich area (22–30% Fe, 27–32% Si). The junctional zone consisted of a poorly mineralised layer at its border with the cusp and an iron-rich layer where it joined the base. The upper part of the base (5% Fe, 16% Si) could be clearly differentiated from the silicon-rich anterior and lower parts of the base (3–4% Fe, 28–35% Si). No minerals were detected in the membrane. The changes in the mineral content of the teeth cusps along the length of the radula were studied. Iron appeared in the cusps at the 25th row and the concentration increased to 28% at the 50th row. The iron was here evenly distributed throughout the cusp. Silicon appeared in the anterior part of the cusp at the 50th row and as it increased in concentration so the iron was displaced, and at the same time the concentration of iron increased in the posterior part of the cusp. Mineralization appeared to be complete by the 150th row.The teeth cusps appear to consist of 800 Å fibres grouped into 1μ thick bundles and the tooth appears to be covered by a thin enamel-like layer.

Here, we ask whether the stimulation of DNA repair could be an evolutionary drive that ensured maintenance and development of early bacterial luminescent systems. To test this hypothesis, we cultivated V. harveyi lux(+) bacteria and luxA mutants in mixed cultures. Initial cultures were mixed to obtain a culture consisting of roughly 50% lux(+) cells and 50% luxA mutants. Then bacteria were cultivated for several days and ratio of luminescent to dark bacteria was measured. Under these conditions, luxA mutants became highly predominant within a few days of cultivation. This indicates that, without a selective pressure, the luminescence is a disadvantage for bacteria, perhaps due to consumption of significant portion of cell energy. However, when the same experiments were repeated but cultures were irradiated with low UV doses, luminescent bacteria started to predominate shortly after the irradiation. Therefore, we conclude that stimulation of photoreactivation may be an evolutionary drive for bacterial bioluminescence.",0.013752988,0.01872535,0.005338977,0.010618988,0.011155485,0.006760411,0.005835843,0.01486645,0.013429593,0.013464342,0.013314193,0.0086297,0.019583002,0.013957285,0.012040948,0.006567083,0.008850885,0.82668275,0.017626306,0.011502651,0.01616049,0.01397261,0.00985648,0.012095911,0.009201146,0.016261214,0.007839905,0.011894403,0.006456237,['bombus terrestris'],[0.0],[0]

The trees are viewed as an integrated part of the system, and as a result are planted, managed, and regularly pruned. Palynological and historical evidence of the manipulation of initial ecosystems by man to obtain a savannah-like ecosystem is presented. The ecological functions of the tree are detailed using results obtained at two complementary scales. At the local scale, strong soil structural differences and functional differences in water budget and patterns of water use are observed under and outside the tree canopy. Using the concept of ecosystem mimicry, the two coexistent components of dehesas can be compared to two distant stages of a secondary succession characterised by very different behaviours. At the regional scale, evidence of relationships between tree density and mean annual precipitation over more than 5000 km2 suggests that the structure of these man-made agroecosystems have adjusted over the long-term and correspond to an optimal functional equilibrium based on the hydrological equilibrium hypothesis.

Some species inhabit the constant darkness of caves as well as the dim, natural photophase of rain-forests. Given the diversity of light regimens experienced by glowworms in their natural environment, true circadian rhythmicity of light output could be present. Consequently the light emission characteristics of the Australian subtropical species Arachnocampa flava, both in their natural rainforest habitat and in artificial conditions in the laboratory, were established. Larvae were taken from rainforest and kept alive in individual containers. When placed in constant darkness (DD) in the laboratory they maintained free-running, cyclical light output for at least 28 days, indicating that light output is regulated by an endogenous rhythm. The characteristics of the light emission changed in DD: individuals showed an increase in the time spent glowing per day and a reduction in the maximum light output. Most individuals show a free-running period greater than 24 h. Manipulation of the photophase and exposure to skeleton photoperiods showed that light acts as both a masking and an entraining agent and suggests that the underlying circadian rhythm is sinusoidal in the absence of light-based masking. Manipulation of thermoperiod in DD showed that temperature cycles are an alternative entraining agent. Exposure to a period of daily feeding in DD failed to entrain the rhythm in the laboratory.

Pioneering studies performed on tethered and dissected insects demonstrate that the sensory, neurological, and musculoskeletal systems play important roles in flight control. Such studies, however, cannot produce an integrative model of insect flight stability because they do not incorporate the interaction of these systems with free-flight aerodynamics. We directly investigate control and stability through the application of torque impulses to freely flying fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) and measurement of their behavioral response. High-speed video and a new motion tracking method capture the aerial “stumble,” and we discover that flies respond to gentle disturbances by accurately returning to their original orientation. These insects take advantage of a stabilizing aerodynamic influence and active torque generation to recover their heading to within 2° in < 60 ms. To explain this recovery behavior, we form a feedback control model that includes the fly’s ability to sense body rotations, process this information, and actuate the wing motions that generate corrective aerodynamic torque. Thus, like early man-made aircraft and modern fighter jets, the fruit fly employs an automatic stabilization scheme that reacts to short time-scale disturbances.",0.011128507,0.01383446,0.015248165,0.009016495,0.02044651,0.024844125,0.015330103,0.007882209,0.012036518,0.009738928,0.00491124,0.00820752,0.013340328,0.023316296,0.009912182,0.006122663,0.8695089,0.012194471,0.012981421,0.021712981,0.019292427,0.01834568,0.02183463,0.012552821,0.010306155,0.010611632,0.009348777,0.007102092,0.022136977,"['tree shrews', 'plants', 'shrews', 'tree shrew', 'nepenthes lowii']","[0.0, 0.057971014492753006, 0.028985507246376004, 0.028985507246376004, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0]"

This development is impaired by removal of ambient total calcium but not by removal of bicarbonate and/or carbonate. In this study we utilized pharmacological agents to target possible acquisition pathways for both Ca2+ and accumulation of carbonate in post-metamorphic, shell-laying embryos. Using whole egg mass flux measurements and ion-specific microelectrode analytical techniques, we have demonstrated that carbonic anhydrase-catalyzed hydration of CO2 is central in the acquisition of both shell-forming ions because it provides the hydrogen ions for an electrogenic vacuolar-type H+-ATPase that fuels the uptake of Ca2+ via voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and possibly an electrogenic Ca2+/1H+ exchanger. Additionally, CO2 hydration provides an endogenous source of HCO –3. Thus, hydration of endogenous CO2 forms HCO –3 for calcification while hydrogen ions are excreted, contributing to continued Ca2+ uptake, as well as creating favorable alkaline internal conditions for calcification. The connections between Ca2+ and HCO –3 acquisition mechanisms that we describe here provide new insight into this efficient, embryonic calcification in freshwater.",0.013643841,0.008354376,0.010109762,0.011956287,0.005333488,0.007946774,0.006642018,0.027278285,0.038334437,0.026493402,0.011527656,0.9060595,0.008020912,0.007744859,0.008916827,0.024072852,0.006785129,0.010592829,0.018837662,0.010622256,0.0134181,0.020354439,0.019158589,0.027215343,0.010403865,0.018784096,0.004236217,0.010716993,0.012363622,"['aphids', 'plants']","[0.043010752688172005, 0.010752688172043001]","[1.0, 0.25]"

The technology has so far been used mainly to remove toxic heavy metals from contaminated soil, but there is a growing interest in broadening its applications to remove/degrade organic pollutants in the environment. Both plants and soil microorganisms have certain limitations with respect to their individual abilities to remove/breakdown organic compounds. A synergistic action by both rhizosphere microorganisms that leads to increased availability of hydrophobic compounds, and plants that leads to their removal and/or degradation, may overcome many of the limitations, and thus provide a useful basis for enhancing remediation of contaminated environments.Main Features The review of literature presented in this article provides an insight to the nature of plant-microbial interactions in the rhizosphere, with a focus on those processes that are relevant to the breakdown and/or removal of organic pollutants. Due consideration has been given to identify opportunities for utilising the plant-microbial synergy in the rhizosphere to enhance remediation of contaminated environments.Results and Discussion The literature review has highlighted the existence of a synergistic interaction between plants and microbial communities in the rhizosphere. This interaction benefits both microorganisms through provision of nutrients by root exudates, and plants through enhanced nutrient uptake and reduced toxicity of soil contaminants. The ability of the plant-microbial interaction to tackle some of the most recalcitrant organic chemicals is of particular interest with regard to enhancing and extending the scope of remediation technologies.Conclusions Plant-microbial interactions in the rhizosphere offer very useful means for remediating environments contaminated with recalcitrant organic compounds.Outlook A better knowledge of plant-microbial interactions will provide a basis for improving the efficacy of biological remediations.

However, recent experimental studies have shown that the adhesion of long tentacle-shaped trichome secretion is not as strong as previously assumed. One may then ask why this flypaper trap is so highly effective. In the present study, we compared geometry, flexibility and the adhesive properties of secretion in different sized trichomes. We have analysed the gross morphology of the plant and its surfaces using light and cryo-scanning electron microscopy. Trichomes' stiffness and the adhesive properties of their secretion on different surfaces were measured. A combination of structural and experimental results, presented in this study, let us suggest that R. gorgonias represents a three-dimensional trap consisting of three functional hierarchical levels (plant, leaves and trichomes). According to their size, we classified three types of trichomes having a particular arrangement on the leaf. The longest trichomes are more flexible and less adhesive compared with the shortest ones. The latter are 48 times stiffer and their secretion has a 9 times higher adhesive strength. Our data support the hypothesis that the shortest trichomes are adapted to strong, long-term adherence to prey insects, and that the longest trichomes are responsible for initial trapping and entanglement function.",0.012844138,0.010533031,0.010347393,0.009134058,0.017971931,0.008319094,0.008683532,0.019143716,0.025910622,0.024303626,0.011091035,0.007218401,0.036453515,0.010749904,0.9074257,0.016573736,0.008701861,0.014155021,0.010665012,0.008943768,0.015536258,0.006869286,0.009158993,0.041752145,0.008054811,0.010491204,0.017308576,0.014740804,0.006978015,[],[],[]

Most were involved in terrestrial egg attachment. Hydrogel glues were subjected to gravimetric analyses and assessed for overall amino acid composition. When 32 proteins in glues from eight insect species were analyzed individually, many proved to be rich in Gly, Ser, and/or Pro, and some contained substantial levels of 4-hydroxyproline. A few proteins were heavily glycosylated. Abundant protein-based secretions were tested as adhesives, mainly by measuring dry shear strength on wood. The strongest (1-2 MPa) was an egg attachment glue produced by saturniid gum moths of the genus Opodiphthera. It was harvested from female colleterial gland reservoirs as a treacle-like liquid that underwent irreversible gelation, and recovered from the capsules of laid eggs as a highly elastic orange-brown hydrogel that could also display high tack. Its protein-based nature was confirmed and explored by spectroscopy, enzymatic degradation, and 2D gel electrophoresis.

Among a large variety of possible structures, two similar keto-enol tautomer/conformers are nearly isoenergetic and markedly more stable than the others both in the gas phase and aqueous solution. The bulk solvent effect was accounted for with the polarizable continuum model (PCM). A distinctive structural feature is the strong intramolecular hydrogen bonding in the keto-enol O-H...O bridge, as shown by analysis of the atoms-in-molecules topological properties of the electron density. To elucidate the claimed strong acidity of these pigments, the site-specific microscopic dissociation constants were also calculated using the cluster-continuum model, a hybrid approach based on inclusion of explicit solvent molecules and solvation of the cluster by the dielectric continuum. Notably, the first deprotonation should occur predominantly from the enolic group with a remarkably low pk(i) value. This factor could play an important role in the potent antibiotic activity of the pigments. The absorption spectra of the undissociated and dissociated compounds in aqueous solution were interpreted with time-dependent DFT/PCM calculations.

709,10.1002/CSSC.201100040,"['Photosynthesis Research', 'Carbon Dioxide Fixation']",https://www.osti.gov/biblio/752960,Editorial: A current perspective on photocatalysis.,"The efficient conversion of solar photons into solar electricity and solar fuels is one of the most important scientific challenges of this century owing to dwindling fossil fuel reserves and the need for clean energy. While research in the direct conversion of solar energy to electricity in the areas of low-cost photovoltaic (PV) systems based on all-inorganic semiconductors, dye-sensitized solar cells, organic, and molecular PV is more technically advanced than its direct conversion to fuels, electricity may not be the ultimate primary solar energy conversion choice owing to the intermittence of solar radiation, the considerable energy loss during transmission, the availability of cost-effective storage media for electricity, and the continuing need for liquid transportation fuels. On the other hand, the direct conversion of solar photons to fuels such as H{sub 2}, CO, alcohols, and hydrocarbons using H{sub 2}O and CO{sub 2} as feedstocks offers a solution for the storage and distribution of solar energy in the form of stable chemical bonds that can be activated to provide energy at arbitrary times and locations. The latter approach to photocatalysis is generally called artificial photosynthesis, and has received renewed interest over the past five or so years. While 'photocatalysis' has not traditionallymore » been restricted to the generation of 'solar fuels,' and has included the production of other useful chemicals, polymerization, and environmental remediation applications, the recent upsurge of interest has been driven mostly by renewable energy issues. It was the pioneering work on photo-electrochemical splitting of water to H{sub 2} and O{sub 2} by n-type TiO{sub 2} using ultraviolet light, by Fujishima and Honda in 1972, that ushered in the area of research that has come to be known as 'solar fuels,' and that has led to the terms 'photocatalysis' and 'solar fuels' becoming almost synonymous. This special issue of ChemSusChem is devoted to providing a current perspective on the field of photocatalysis. It contains invited papers from leading researchers in a wide range of important aspects of the field that address materials, photophysical, photochemical, and electrocatalysis issues. The area remains primarily the domain of basic research studies because progress toward the promise offered by the early work has (at least until recently) been slow, despite its significance having become increasingly recognized. The present collection of papers deals with new semiconductor photocatalysts, molecular catalysts for hydrogen production and water oxidation, dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells, and electrochemical CO{sub 2} reduction. Overall photochemical water splitting without any applied bias potential is achieved in several systems, especially under UV irradiation. Further advances are also achieved in a few semiconductor systems, such as GaZn oxynitrides or two-step (so-called 'Z-scheme') systems to produce H{sub 2} and O{sub 2} without any sacrificial reagent under visible irradiation. When band gaps of semiconductors are narrowed to absorb more visible light for greater efficiency, or when band positions are not suitable for carrying out one-electron redox processes, multielectron catalysts are required to promote proton-coupled electron transfer reactions in producing solar fuels. In homogeneous photocatalysis systems, sacrificial reagents are typically used to investigate the catalytic activity, detailed kinetics, and mechanisms of a half reaction. Photoelectrolysis systems with immobilized catalysts (metals, metal oxides, or molecular catalysts) on electrodes can separate oxidized products, such as O{sub 2}, and reduced products, such as H{sub 2}, CO, CH{sub 3}OH, and others, by means of proton- or hydroxide-conducting membranes. The following paragraphs briefly summarize these contributions. In the area of UV-driven water splitting, Townsend et al. prepared Pt-and/or IrO{sub x}-coated niobate (Nb{sub 6}O{sub 17}{sup 4-}) nanoscrolls and tested photochemical water reduction with methanol as a sacrificial reagent, and water oxidation with AgNO{sub 3} as a sacrificial reagent. In this work, factors for improving the limited photocatalytic activity of the system are explored. Nishiyama et al. investigated factors controlling the photocatalytic water splitting activity, such as preparation temperature and crystallinity of the semiconductor materials, the amount of co-catalyst loading, and the degree of dispersion of the co-catalyst with RuO{sub 2}-loaded niobium and tantalum bronzes, M{sub 8}P{sub 4}O{sub 32}{sup 4-} (M=Nb, Ta). Their DFT calculations demonstrate that severe distortion of NbO{sub 6} octahedra plays an important role in photocatalytic water splitting.« less",0.00892857,0.014474968,0.026599051,0.010610085,0.028877387,0.006917671,0.005550928,0.86838764,0.016824638,0.016498378,0.012141083,0.044484496,0.024440037,0.009139066,0.012037272,0.011111423,0.006638251,0.01400964,0.016346185,0.011247403,0.009918791,0.006818602,0.010051595,0.027752837,0.011421854,0.011962806,0.008347268,0.015141489,0.01290755,[],[],[]

Whilst some animals use the orientation of the electric field vector (e-vector) for navigation and orientation [3], the ability to discriminate angular differences in e-vector has been implicated in object recognition for predator/prey detection [4,5] as well as signalling and communication [6]. In all animals previously tested, however, the resolution of e-vector angle discrimination has been found to be in the range 10–20° [5,7,8], which is inadequate for the typical e-vector differences measured in relevant natural visual scenes [9]. In this study, we found that mourning cuttlefish ( Sepia plangon ) are able to detect differences between e-vector orientations as small as 1°. Not only is this the most acute e-vector angle discrimination measured behaviourally in any animal, but it provides a high enough resolution to be relevant to real world visual tasks. We analysed natural underwater scenes using computer based polarisation imaging. When we increased the resolution of our system, we discovered information not detected using normal-resolution imaging polarimetry and invisible to animals lacking fine e-vector angle discrimination. For example, we found that high-resolution e-vector discrimination provides a new way of breaking typical intensity-based background matching. S. plangon lacks colour vision, like most other cephalopods, and high-resolution polarisation vision may provide an alternative source of contrast information that is just as fine-scale.",0.016712546,0.8676113,0.011831503,0.013953768,0.00861297,0.012118794,0.009631341,0.011781984,0.008738847,0.009746942,0.004855067,0.007103581,0.01020903,0.01049837,0.007215838,0.005008245,0.007290596,0.0141556,0.008339918,0.010840684,0.007827816,0.01353318,0.030990722,0.007846098,0.01189024,0.013014553,0.013696458,0.009888979,0.014264396,"['beetles', 'tenebrionidae', 'insects']","[0.013698630136986, 0.013698630136986, 0.013698630136986]","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0]"

Except for sloths, all mammals show the late ossification of the caudal-most centra in the neck after other centra and neural arches. In sloths with 8–10 ribless neck vertebrae, the caudal-most neck centra ossify early, matching the pattern observed in cranial thoracic vertebrae of other mammals. Accordingly, we interpret the ribless neck vertebrae of three-toed sloths caudal to V7 as thoracic based on our developmental criterion.

This visually evoked response, which can be elicited without exposing the insect to any airflow, presumably serves to reduce the aerodynamic drag that would otherwise be produced by the abdomen during real flight. The response is critically dependent on the presence of appropriate image motion everywhere within the large field of view of the insect.

Porter et al. hypothesize that this shape provides better functionality and strength than a round cross section (see the Perspective by Ashley-Ross). Three-dimensional printed models show that square cross section shapes behave more advantageously when subjected to compressive forces. By allowing greater deformation without damage and accommodating twisting deformations, square appendages passively return to their original configurations. The added flexibility of the square cross section enhances the tail's ability to grasp objects. Science, this issue 10.1126/science.aaa6683; see also p. 30 3D-printed models show that square profile seahorse tails have better crush resistance and grasping ability than do circular ones. [Also see Perspective by Ashley-Ross] INTRODUCTION Although the predominant shapes of most animal tails are cylindrical, seahorse tails are square prisms. The skeleton of their tails consists of a bony armor arranged into several ringlike segments composed of four L-shaped plates that surround a central vertebra. These plates articulate with specialized joints that facilitate bending and twisting, as well as resist vertebral fracture from crushing. Muscles attached to the vertebral column transmit forces to the bony plates to provide motion for grasping and holding on to objects such as sea grasses, mangrove roots, and coral reefs, which allows them to hide and rely on camouflage when evading predators and capturing prey. RATIONALE We hypothesize that the square cross-sectional architecture of a seahorse tail improves mechanical performance in prehension (grasping ability) and armored functions (crushing resistance), relative to a cylindrical one. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the mechanics of two three-dimensional (3D)–printed prototypes composed of articulating plates and vertebrae that mimic the natural (square prism) and a hypothetical (cylindrical) tail structure. We compared the bending, twisting, and compressive behavior of the biomimetic prototypes to show that the square profile is better than the circular one for two integrated functions: grasping ability and crushing resistance. RESULTS Seahorse tails (and the prototypes) have three primary joints that enable motion: ball-and-socket, peg-and-socket, and gliding. The ball-and-socket joints connect adjacent vertebrae and constrain bending in both the square and cylindrical prototypes to the same degree, exhibiting a behavior similar to that of a natural seahorse tail. The peg-and-socket joints connect the plates of adjacent segments and substantially restrict twisting in the prototype with a square profile, as compared with the circular one. The square geometry limits excessive torsion and preserves articulatory organization, which could provide seahorses a natural safety factor against torsion-induced damage and assist in tail relaxation. Further, the square architecture is flat (increasing surface contact) and undergoes an exterior shape change when twisted, which could allow seahorses to grasp objects with more control. Gliding joints are present at the plate overlaps along all four sides of both prototypes. Under transverse compression and impact (with a rubber mallet), the plates of the square prototype slide past one another with one degree of translation freedom (analogous to the crushing behavior of a natural seahorse tail), exhibiting a response that is stiffer, stronger, and more resilient than its cylindrical counterpart, whose plates translate and rotate on impact. CONCLUSION Exploration of these biologically inspired designs provides insight into the mechanical benefits for seahorses to have evolved prehensile tails composed of armored plates organized into square prisms. Beyond their intended practical applications, engineering designs are convenient means to answer elusive biological questions when live animal data are unavailable (for example, seahorses do not have cylindrical tails). Understanding the role of mechanics in these prototypes may help engineers to develop future seahorse-inspired technologies that mimic the prehensile and armored functions of the natural appendage for a variety of applications in robotics, defense systems, or biomedicine. Engineering designs answer biological questions. 3D-printed models that mimic a seahorse tail were designed not only for potential engineering applications but also to answer the biological question, why might tails organized into square prisms be better than cylinders? A mechanical comparison of the prototypes shows that articulated square prisms perform better than do cylinders for grasping and resistance to crushing. Whereas the predominant shapes of most animal tails are cylindrical, seahorse tails are square prisms. Seahorses use their tails as flexible grasping appendages, in spite of a rigid bony armor that fully encases their bodies. We explore the mechanics of two three-dimensional–printed models that mimic either the natural (square prism) or hypothetical (cylindrical) architecture of a seahorse tail to uncover whether or not the square geometry provides any functional advantages. Our results show that the square prism is more resilient when crushed and provides a mechanism for preserving articulatory organization upon extensive bending and twisting, as compared with its cylindrical counterpart. Thus, the square architecture is better than the circular one in the context of two integrated functions: grasping ability and crushing resistance.",0.01641055,0.025283093,0.012059937,0.017019985,0.055630025,0.01875677,0.014466326,0.010083911,0.00804579,0.020801028,0.012302652,0.011057957,0.033113305,0.020252714,0.016239047,0.011225677,0.021630121,0.017945962,0.013994952,0.012973079,0.017478053,0.013537351,0.017341105,0.02049033,0.8638692,0.020239191,0.7872799,0.039655898,0.024059894,"['plants', 'hyparrhenia diplandra', 'poaceae']","[0.015873015873015, 0.015873015873015, 0.015873015873015]","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0]"

The peptides were isolated from the body wall, their amino acid sequences determined, and identical peptides synthesized. Two peptides, which we named holokinins, are homologous with bradykinin.

Previously, it has been demonstrated only in the Red-necked Phalarope Phalaropus lobatus. On the basis of a model of the bill morphology necessary for this method of prey transport, I suggest that many species of shorebird should be capable of surface tension feeding. Laboratory investigations of the feeding mechanics of Wilson's Phalarope Phalaropus tricolor, Western Sandpiper Calidris mauri and Least Sandpiper Calidris minutilla demonstrated that all three use surface tension transport of prey when feeding in water. I examined interspecific variation in the performance of this feeding mechanism with a high-speed video system and a customized motion analysis system. Exploratory analyses indicated significant interspecific variation in distance the prey is transported per cycle of mandibular spreading, gape increase per unit transport, speed of transport, total number of cycles necessary to complete transport and total time to complete transport. The calidrid sandpipers also occasionally used other feeding mechanisms in conjunction with surface tension transport of prey. The discovery that these sandpipers, which normally obtain prey by probing, are capable of surface tension transport of prey implies that the capacity to employ this feeding mechanism may be widespread in the Scolopacidae and may have been a significant factor in the evolutionary radiation of phalaropes into aquatic environments.",0.91102403,0.007059175,0.016820664,0.015919877,0.006326859,0.009735042,0.005043662,0.003533854,0.003949642,0.012046911,0.012010547,0.009427843,0.008690093,0.013071197,0.005884552,0.008467742,0.004154658,0.010280152,0.017991457,0.014914538,0.008387018,0.007925582,0.013072187,0.005635724,0.00699288,0.005526887,0.005100125,0.010199085,0.010582899,"['bos taurus', 'dissostichus', 'tuna', 'fish', 'bigeye', 'thunnus', 'bigeye tuna', 'bos', 'fishes', 'antarctic toothfish', 'cow', 'thunnus obesus', 'dissostichus mawsoni']","[0.008620689655172, 0.008620689655172, 0.025862068965517, 0.043103448275862, 0.008620689655172, 0.008620689655172, 0.008620689655172, 0.008620689655172, 0.008620689655172, 0.0, 0.051724137931034, 0.008620689655172, 0.008620689655172]","[0.16666666666666602, 0.16666666666666602, 0.5, 0.833333333333333, 0.16666666666666602, 0.16666666666666602, 0.16666666666666602, 0.16666666666666602, 0.16666666666666602, 0.0, 1.0, 0.16666666666666602, 0.16666666666666602]"

However, ant densities are low in tropical montane habitats, thereby limiting the potential benefits of the carnivorous syndrome. Nepenthes lowii, a montane species from Borneo, produces two types of pitchers that differ greatly in form and function. Pitchers produced by immature plants conform to the ‘typical’ Nepenthes pattern, catching arthropod prey. However, pitchers produced by mature N. lowii plants lack the features associated with carnivory and are instead visited by tree shrews, which defaecate into them after feeding on exudates that accumulate on the pitcher lid. We tested the hypothesis that tree shrew faeces represent a significant nitrogen (N) source for N. lowii, finding that it accounts for between 57 and 100 per cent of foliar N in mature N. lowii plants. Thus, N. lowii employs a diversified N sequestration strategy, gaining access to a N source that is not available to sympatric congeners.

Aphids are able to successfully puncture sieve tubes with their piercing mouthparts (stylets) and ingest phloem sap without eliciting the sieve tubes' normal occlusion response to injury. Occlusion mechanisms are calcium-triggered and may be prevented by chemical constituents in aphid saliva injected into sieve tubes before and during feeding. We recorded aphid feeding behavior with the electrical penetration graph (EPG) technique and then experimentally induced sieve tube plugging. Initiation of sieve tube occlusion caused a change in aphid behavior from phloem sap ingestion to secretion of watery saliva. Direct proof of “unplugging” properties of aphid saliva was provided by the effect of aphid saliva on forisomes. Forisomes are proteinaceous inclusions in sieve tubes of legumes that show calcium-regulated changes in conformation between a contracted state (below calcium threshold) that does not occlude the sieve tubes and a dispersed state (above calcium threshold) that occludes the sieve tubes. We demonstrated in vitro that aphid saliva induces dispersed forisomes to revert back to the nonplugging contracted state. Labeling Western-blotted saliva proteins with 45Ca2+ or ruthenium red inferred the presence of calcium-binding domains. These results demonstrate that aphid saliva has the ability to prevent sieve tube plugging by molecular interactions between salivary proteins and calcium.

The terrestrial vegetation produces an amazing diversity of volatile compounds, which are then transported, mixed, and degraded in the atmosphere. Each insect species expresses a set of olfactory receptors that bind part of the volatile compounds present in its habitat. Insect odorscapes are thus defined as species-specific olfactory spaces, dependent on the local habitat, and dynamic in time. Manipulations of pest-insect odorscapes are a promising approach to answer the strong demand for pesticide-free plant-protection strategies. Moreover, understanding their olfactory environment becomes a major concern in the context of global change and environmental stresses to insect populations. A considerable amount of information is available on the identity of volatiles mediating biotic interactions that involve insects. However, in the large body of research devoted to understanding how insects use olfaction to locate resources, an integrative vision of the olfactory environment has rarely been reached. This article aims to better apprehend the nature of the insect odorscape and its importance to insect behavioral ecology by reviewing the literature specific to different disciplines from plant ecophysiology to insect neuroethology. First, we discuss the determinants of odorscape composition, from the production of volatiles by plants (section “Plant Metabolism and Volatile Emissions”) to their filtering during detection by the olfactory system of insects (section “Insect Olfaction: How Volatile Plant Compounds Are Encoded and Integrated by the Olfactory System”). We then summarize the physical and chemical processes by which volatile chemicals distribute in space (section “Transportation of Volatile Plant Compounds and Spatial Aspects of the Odorscape”) and time (section “Temporal Aspects: The Dynamics of the Odorscape”) in the atmosphere. The following sections consider the ecological importance of background odors in odorscapes and how insects adapt to their olfactory environment. Habitat provides an odor background and a sensory context that modulate the responses of insects to pheromones and other olfactory signals (section “Ecological Importance of Odorscapes”). In addition, insects do not respond inflexibly to single elements in their odorscape but integrate several components of their environment (section “Plasticity and Adaptation to Complex and Variable Odorscapes”). We finally discuss existing methods of odorscape manipulation for sustainable pest insect control and potential future developments in the context of agroecology (section “Odorscapes in Plant Protection and Agroecology”).",0.033307504,0.020243896,0.012156724,0.07211051,0.014807923,0.006248927,0.009652268,0.010452191,0.009486542,0.015479896,0.006142486,0.015672892,0.01494703,0.86545736,0.01234308,0.013330786,0.028752336,0.01644894,0.03107778,0.006108325,0.007472606,0.011948843,0.016849479,0.011858495,0.019138018,0.012933847,0.01421649,0.01730341,0.020402491,[],[],[]

Sequence analysis suggested that this protein is a flavin-containing l-amino acid oxidase (LAAO), with one predicted potential glycosylation site, although the glycosylation could not be experimentally confirmed. This protein, which we call `escapin', has high sequence similarity to several other gastropod proteins. Escapin was verified by NMR, mass spectroscopy and HPLC to have FAD as its flavin cofactor. Escapin's antimicrobial effects, bacteriostasis and bactericidal, were determined using a combination of two assays: (1) incubation of bacteria on solid media followed by assessment of inhibition by direct observation of zones of inhibition or by turbidity measurements; and (2) incubation of bacteria in liquid media followed by counting viable colonies after growing on agar plates. Native escapin inhibited the growth of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including marine bacteria (Vibrio harveyii and Staphylococcus aureus) and pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Escapin also inhibited the growth of yeast and fungi, with different efficacies. Escapin's antimicrobial activity was concentration dependent and did not decrease when stored for more than 5 months at room temperature. Escapin was bacteriostatic and not bactericidal in minimal media (e.g. salt media) with glucose, yeast extract, and a mixture of 20 amino acids each at 50 μmol l-1, but was bactericidal in media enriched with Tryptone Peptone. Escapin was also strongly bactericidal in media with l-lysine at concentrations as low as 3 mmol l-1 and slightly bactericidal in 50 mmol l-1 l-arginine, but not in most other amino acids even at 50 mmol l-1. Escapin had high oxidase activity (producing hydrogen peroxide) with either l-arginine or l-lysine as a substrate and little to no oxidase activity with other l-amino acids. Hydrogen peroxide alone (without escapin or amino acids) was strongly bacteriostatic but poorly bactericidal, similar in this respect to l-arginine but different from l-lysine in the presence of escapin. Together these results suggest that there are multiple mechanisms to escapin's antimicrobial effects, with bacteriostasis resulting largely or entirely from the effects of hydrogen peroxide produced by escapin's LAAO activity, but bactericidal effects resulting from lysine-dependent mechanisms not directly involving hydrogen peroxide. Recombinant escapin expressed in bacteria was also active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, suggesting that glycosylation is not essential for antimicrobial activity.",0.00753942,0.007961957,0.005174352,0.004922632,0.011556384,0.006680907,0.009140922,0.005683716,0.007611764,0.009518102,0.010460938,0.010010078,0.011254304,0.006883465,0.007785684,0.011257648,0.007906031,0.00698584,0.00684218,0.007688637,0.010848654,0.010437247,0.006870064,0.009414324,0.00927918,0.9406011,0.007474972,0.012732546,0.006824278,['rheum palaestinum'],[0.1],[1.0]

Pigment cells are interesting for biosensing purposes since they provide an easily monitored physiological phenomenon. Melanophores, containing dark brown melanin pigment granules, constitute an important class of chromatophores. Their melanin-filled pigment granules may be stimulated to undergo rapid dispersion throughout the melanophores (cells appear dark), or aggregation to the center of the melanophores (cells appear light). This simple physiological response can easily be measured in a photometer. Selected G protein coupled receptors can be functionally expressed in cultured frog melanophores. Here, we demonstrate the use of recombinant frog melanophores as a biosensor for the detection of opioids. Melanophores were transfected with the human opioid receptor 3 and used for opiate detection. The response to the opioid receptor agonist morphine and a synthetic opioid peptide was analyzed by absorbance readings in an aggregation assay. It was shown that both agonists caused aggregation of pigment granules in the melanophores, and the cells appeared lighter. The pharmacology of the expressed receptors was very similar to its mammalian counterpart, as evidenced by competitive inhibition by increasing concentrations of the opioid receptor inhibitor naloxone. Transfection of melanophores with selected receptors enables the creation of numerous melanophore biosensors, which respond selectively to certain substances. The melanophore biosensor has potential use for measurement of substances in body fluids such as saliva, blood plasma and urine.",0.035670653,0.05642908,0.015727017,0.64749944,0.010819776,0.030784342,0.016767226,0.015457384,0.012044572,0.027752887,0.07299355,0.031805586,0.026342116,0.07105505,0.016057262,0.027018381,0.01948084,0.018027706,0.01629776,0.020338325,0.019914418,0.05528304,0.89085066,0.011178464,0.027505234,0.017048746,0.010694716,0.028999891,0.02728998,"['bacteria', 'serratia marcescens', 'pseudomonas aeruginosa']","[0.024691358024691003, 0.012345679012345002, 0.012345679012345002]","[1.0, 0.5, 0.5]"

We aim to determine whether dew water collection is also possible for desert insects. For this purpose, we investigated the infra-red emissivity, and the wetting and structural properties, of the surface of the elytra of a preserved specimen of Physasterna cribripes (Tenebrionidæ) beetle, where the macro-structure appears as a series of “bumps”, with “valleys” between them. Dew formation experiments were carried out in a condensation chamber. The surface properties (infra-red emissivity, wetting properties) were dominated by the wax at the elytra surface and, to a lower extent, its micro-structure. We performed scanning electron microscope on histological sections and determined the infra-red emissivity using a scanning pyrometer. The emissivity measured (0.95±0.07 between 8–14μm) was close to the black body value. Dew formation occurred on the insect’s elytra, which can be explained by these surface properties. From the surface coverage of the condensed drops it was found that dew forms primarily in the valleys between the bumps. The difference in droplet nucleation rate between bumps and valleys can be attributed to the hexagonal microstructure on the surface of the valleys, whereas the surface of the bumps is smooth. The drops can slide when they reach a critical size, and be collected at the insect's mouth.Graphical abstract",0.021674115,0.004789197,0.007967861,0.0046111,0.003099195,0.00369967,0.003499715,0.005236831,0.011114144,0.00905357,0.006345407,0.006877535,0.006584757,0.004786832,0.003878358,0.021339506,0.003528087,0.006691938,0.0196132,0.014952766,0.004451593,0.002121731,0.014049565,0.00529961,0.003869749,0.004383743,0.005057462,0.21613964,0.003805517,['earthworm'],[0.1],[1.0]

One hypothesis suggests that bacteria from the genus Pseudonocardia are the sole, co-evolved mutualists of attine ants and are transmitted vertically by the queens. A recent study identified a Pseudonocardia-produced antifungal, named dentigerumycin, associated with the lower attine Apterostigma dentigerum consistent with the idea that co-evolved Pseudonocardia make novel antibiotics. An alternative possibility is that attine ants sample actinomycete bacteria from the soil, selecting and maintaining those species that make useful antibiotics. Consistent with this idea, a Streptomyces species associated with the higher attine Acromyrmex octospinosus was recently shown to produce the well-known antifungal candicidin. Candicidin production is widespread in environmental isolates of Streptomyces, so this could either be an environmental contaminant or evidence of recruitment of useful actinomycetes from the environment. It should be noted that the two possibilities for actinomycete acquisition are not necessarily mutually exclusive.ResultsIn order to test these possibilities we isolated bacteria from a geographically distinct population of A. octospinosus and identified a candicidin-producing Streptomyces species, which suggests that they are common mutualists of attine ants, most probably recruited from the environment. We also identified a Pseudonocardia species in the same ant colony that produces an unusual polyene antifungal, providing evidence for co-evolution of Pseudonocardia with A. octospinosus.ConclusionsOur results show that a combination of co-evolution and environmental sampling results in the diversity of actinomycete symbionts and antibiotics associated with attine ants.",0.00838542,0.007750471,0.005068912,0.005122174,0.011749599,0.005827505,0.010411385,0.005596404,0.006517533,0.008887726,0.010536366,0.009250503,0.012565332,0.007376083,0.007064642,0.011671264,0.007864706,0.006588492,0.007454566,0.007296279,0.010922683,0.009392573,0.007270452,0.008309838,0.009918632,0.93564236,0.00715724,0.010353738,0.007887878,"['bee', 'antirrhinum majus', 'snapdragon', 'humans', 'bees']","[0.035714285714285005, 0.0, 0.011904761904761, 0.011904761904761, 0.035714285714285005]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304, 1.0]"

Further, exposed nests built in 1995 (a rainy year) were much smaller than those of 1994 and 1996, and the amount of secretion in that year was much greater than in the other years. The nitrogen content of adult workers, immatures, those left inside cells and the oral secretion in nests of 1996 showed that 10–20% of total protein resources brought in during the founding phase may be devoted to producing the secretion.

Using observational and experimental data, we tested whether a solitary bee (female Anthophora plumipes) uses scent marking while foraging on flowers of Cerinthe major in Portugal. Females used scent marks with at least two components that differed in their volatility and, furthermore, recognized the marks of different individuals. A very short-term component (<3 min) was attractive, resulting in the observed high level of immediate revisits: this component appeared to be adjusted according to the foraging needs of the moment. A longer-term component (<30 min) was initially repellent and matched the rate of nectar renewal; it, or the response to it, also appeared to be adjusted to the perceived level of nectar reward. There may be even longer-term effects associated with the specific foraging areas of individual bees. Observed differences in the way in which individuals responded to scent marks indicate that they may play a role as part of a dominance or exclusion mechanism among females.

They are able, for example, to guide the formation of smoothly curving single crystals or tough, lightweight, self-repairing skeletal elements. In many biominerals, an organic matrix interacts with the mineral as it forms, controls its morphology and polymorph, and is occluded during mineralization. The remarkable functional properties of the resulting composites—such as outstanding fracture toughness and wear resistance—can be attributed to buried organic–inorganic interfaces at multiple hierarchical levels. Analysing and controlling such interfaces at the nanometre length scale is critical also in emerging organic electronic and photovoltaic hybrid materials. However, elucidating the structural and chemical complexity of buried organic–inorganic interfaces presents a challenge to state-of-the-art imaging techniques. Here we show that pulsed-laser atom-probe tomography reveals three-dimensional chemical maps of organic fibres with a diameter of 5–10 nm in the surrounding nano-crystalline magnetite (Fe3O4) mineral in the tooth of a marine mollusc, the chiton Chaetopleura apiculata. Remarkably, most fibres co-localize with either sodium or magnesium. Furthermore, clustering of these cations in the fibre indicates a structural level of hierarchy previously undetected. Our results demonstrate that in the chiton tooth, individual organic fibres have different chemical compositions, and therefore probably different functional roles in controlling fibre formation and matrix–mineral interactions. Atom-probe tomography is able to detect this chemical/structural heterogeneity by virtue of its high three-dimensional spatial resolution and sensitivity across the periodic table. We anticipate that the quantitative analysis and visualization of nanometre-scale interfaces by laser-pulsed atom-probe tomography will contribute greatly to our understanding not only of biominerals (such as bone, dentine and enamel), but also of synthetic organic–inorganic composites.",0.023414733,0.018835284,0.02729344,0.012698372,0.09711257,0.017567499,0.7712528,0.010107386,0.025767764,0.01137597,0.01713494,0.014026887,0.03367831,0.011348134,0.020525824,0.04044483,0.035356857,0.014308541,0.01589778,0.021917878,0.6857425,0.02100915,0.05103004,0.019559849,0.02540678,0.039281517,0.018295458,0.02252637,0.05009817,['plants'],[0.011764705882352],[1.0]

No cold-cataract occurs in the giant Antarctic toothfish Dissostichus mawsoni lens when cooled to temperatures as low as –12°C, indicating highly cold-stable lens proteins. To investigate this cold stability, we characterised the lens crystallin proteins of the Antarctic toothfish, in parallel with those of the sub-tropical bigeye tuna Thunnus obesus and the endothermic cow Bos taurus, representing three disparate thermal climes (–2°C, 18°C and 37°C, respectively). Sizing chromatography resolved their lens crystallins into three groups,α /βH, β and γ, with γ crystallins being the most abundant (>40%) lens proteins in fish, in contrast to the cow lens where they comprise only 19%. The upper thermal stability of these crystallin components correlated with the body temperature of the species. In vitro chaperone assays showed that fish α crystallin can protect same-species γ crystallins from heat denaturation, as well as lysozyme from DTT-induced unfolding, and therefore are small Heat Shock Proteins (sHSP) like their mammalian counterparts. Dynamic light scattering measured an increase in size of αγ crystallin mixtures upon heating, which supports formation of the αγ complex as an integral part of the chaperone process. Surprisingly, in cross-species chaperone assays, tunaα crystallins only partly protected toothfish γ crystallins, while cow α crystallins completely failed to protect, indicating partial and no αγ interaction, respectively. Toothfish γ was likely to be the component that failed to interact, as the supernatant from a cowα plus toothfish γ incubation could chaperone cow γ crystallins in a subsequent heat incubation, indicating the presence of uncomplexed cow α. This suggests that the inability of toothfish γ crystallins to fully complex with tuna α, and not at all with the cowα crystallins, may have its basis in adaptive changes in the protein that relate to the extreme cold-stability of the toothfish lens.",0.007075624,0.012701559,0.007819606,0.004333388,0.010605221,0.012039711,0.008409987,0.005460965,0.010692391,0.006745689,0.011586185,0.005683085,0.006370265,0.004502056,0.003991825,0.013846846,0.005470561,0.007960375,0.005515765,0.007543442,0.009680761,0.006503278,0.9388294,0.003737657,0.007584488,0.008017829,0.006736976,0.008363023,0.009643789,['insects'],[0.014492753623188002],[1.0]

To maximize sensitivity to the relatively brighter downwelling sunlight, to view the silhouette of animals above them, and to increase the binocular overlap of their eyes, many mesopelagic animals have developed upward-pointing tubular eyes. However, these sacrifice the ability to detect bioluminescent and reflective objects in other directions. Thus, some mesopelagic fish with tubular eyes extend their visual fields laterally and/or ventrally by lensless ocular diverticula, which are thought to provide unfocused images, allowing only simple detection of objects, with little spatial resolution. Here, we show that a medial mirror within the ventrally facing ocular diverticulum of the spookfish, Dolichopteryx longipes, consisting of a multilayer stack derived from a retinal tapetum, is used to reflect light onto a lateral retina. The reflective plates are not orientated parallel to the surface of the mirror. Instead, plate angles change progressively around the mirror, and computer modeling indicates that this provides a well-focused image.

Soils, food, and ground water contaminated with arsenic pose serious health risks to millions of people in different parts of the World. While engineering methods to remediate arsenic-contaminated environments are available, they are often prohibitively expensive and cumbersome. It was discovered about a decade ago that the Chinese brake fern (Pteris vittata) had an extraordinary ability to tolerate and hyperaccumulate arsenic, up to about 2% of dry weight in its fronds. This opened up new opportunities to develop the brake fern for a cost-effective green technology to remediate arsenic-contaminated environments. The objective of this review is to highlight some of the salient findings on this and related ferns regarding their arsenic tolerance and hyperaccumulation traits. Investigations have shown that arsenic hyperaccumulation in brake fern has evolved as a defense against herbivory. Research employing molecular biology tools have identified some of the key genes and proteins important for arsenic metabolism in this species including genes for arsenic-induced oxidative stress. Comparative biochemistry of how organisms adapt to arsenic suggests that many other fern genes related to arsenic transport and metabolism are yet to be characterized in this fern. Our research indicates that brake fern could be a source of genes that could inform us about how plants adapt to abiotic stress factors such as high temperature stress and drought that have oxidative stress as a component.

Although organisms living in different thermal habitats may exhibit morphological plasticity or move from unfavorable locations, there are few examples of animals adjusting their thermal properties in response to short‐term changes in local conditions. Here, we show that the intertidal sea star Pisaster ochraceus modulates its thermal inertia in response to prior thermal exposure. After exposure to high body temperature at low tide, sea stars increase the amount of colder‐than‐air fluid in their coelomic cavity when submerged during high tide, resulting in a lower body temperature during the subsequent low tide. Moreover, this buffering capacity is more effective when seawater is cold during the previous high tide.

(Polygonaceae), commonly known as desert rhubarb, is endemic to Jordan and southern Israel and grows in areas with low annual rainfall (Al-Eisawi 1998). It has an underground woody stem and grows mostly in shallow ravines of stonysandy terrains during the winter and early spring in years with above-normal precipitation. It produces one to four rounded leaves, 20–60 cm in diameter, with a wrinkled surface (fig. 1). The large leaf size of this species is atypical within arid ecosystems; in the presence of abundant sun, small leaf size is considered as one of the most common patterns of desert plants to decrease transpiration rates and increase water-use efficiency (Gibson 1996). The annual precipitation in Jordan’s desert is less than 75 mm, and January is the wettest month (Tarawneh & Kadıoğlu 2002). A preliminary study of the relationship between precipitation patterns and leaf growth suggested complex and under-studied water-absorption strategies for plants growing in arid environments. Our personal observations showed some unique morphologies and timing patterns that perennial plants in the tableland desert of Jordan have developed as survival strategies. A previous study showed that the large size and surface morphology of rhubarb leaves help to create a self-irrigation system and increase rainwater harvesting by 16-fold compared to other desert plants (Lev-Yadun et al. 2008). A simple leaf morphology can effectively drain rainwater without the need for wrinkles that dramatically increase leaf transpiration area, as has been shown for the lotus leaf (Barthlott & Neinhuis 1996). The leaf morphology of rhubarb may not play a crucial role in water collection, as rainfall is limited during its maximum growth period (March–April). Additionally, the leaves are tightly attached to the ground and the margins are bent downward to contact the soil; these morphological features favour the function of a vapour-trapping system under the leaf rather than water drainage on the upper surface. Rainwater collection is related to the leaf horizontal catchment area and not to the surface area maximized by the wrinkles. Because the water absorption rate needs to be higher than the transpiration rate, rhubarb leaf wrinkles increase the leaf surface area relative to the leaf footprint and",0.91779864,0.008019061,0.014694311,0.010694565,0.007303041,0.010358458,0.005632246,0.00381296,0.00378799,0.014055444,0.00947344,0.008881944,0.008440868,0.014894408,0.007851813,0.009003088,0.004918896,0.010067911,0.019156236,0.018228693,0.008201059,0.00749692,0.010673577,0.006763557,0.008110664,0.005799628,0.006193005,0.009520611,0.010460159,['plants'],[0.029411764705882002],[1.0]

Each monomer is an eight-stranded antiparallel beta-barrel, remarkably similar to that of the genetically distinct bacterial analog streptavidin. As in streptavidin, binding of biotin involves a highly stabilized network of polar and hydrophobic interactions. There are, however, some differences. The presence of additional hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups in the binding site of avidin (which are missing in streptavidin) may account for its higher affinity constant.

Mantis shrimp (Stomatopoda) must store considerable elastic energy prior to their rapid raptorial strikes; however, little is known about the dynamics and location of elastic energy storage structures in this system. We used computed tomography (CT) to visualize the mineralization patterns in Gonodactylaceus falcatus and high speed videography of Odontodactylus scyllarus to observe the dynamics of spring loading. Using a materials testing apparatus, we measured the force and work required to contract the elastic structures in G. falcatus. There was a positive linear correlation between contraction force and contraction distance; alternative model tests further supported the use of a linear model. Therefore, we modeled the system as a Hookean spring. The force required to fully compress the spring was positively correlated with body mass and appendage size, but the spring constant did not scale with body size, suggesting a possible role of muscle constraints in the scaling of this system. One hypothesized elastic storage structure, the saddle, only contributed approximately 11% of the total measured force, thus suggesting that primary site of elastic energy storage is in the mineralized ventral bars found in the merus segment of the raptorial appendages. Furthermore, the intact system exhibited 81% resilience and severing the saddle resulted in a non-significant reduction to 77% resilience. The remarkable shapes and mineralization patterns that characterize the mantis shrimp's raptorial appendage further reveal a highly integrated mechanical power amplification system based on exoskeletal elastic energy storage.",0.004967159,0.003728161,0.005924865,0.001993196,0.171204,0.014212983,0.016412029,0.004811593,0.004718463,0.01839212,0.002204118,0.001780892,0.004584969,0.00370973,0.006992823,0.003793174,0.01527115,0.004041251,0.003991239,0.004169135,0.016956266,0.00443471,0.005411489,0.004348307,0.008256821,0.006015262,0.051825956,0.004343801,0.13829452,"['odontocymbiola magellanica', 'molluscs']","[0.034482758620689, 0.017241379310344]","[1.0, 0.5]"

Despite the ubiquity of this type of coloration, neither the relative contribution of structures and pigments to variation in such colour displays nor the relative effects of extrinsic factors on the structural and pigment-based components of such colour has been determined. Understanding the sources of colour variation is important because structures and pigments may convey different information to conspecifics. In an experiment on captive American goldfinches Carduelis tristis, we manipulated two parameters, carotenoid availability and food availability, known to affect the expression of carotenoid pigments in a full-factorial design. Yellow feathers from these birds were then analysed in two ways. First, we used full-spectrum spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography to examine the extent to which variation in white structural colour and total carotenoid content was associated with variation in colour properties of feathers. The carotenoid content of yellow feathers predicted two colour parameters (principal component 1—representing high values of ultraviolet and yellow chroma and low values of violet–blue chroma—and hue). Two different colour parameters (violet–blue and yellow chroma) from white de-pigmented feathers, as well as carotenoid content, predicted reflectance measurements from yellow feathers. Second, we determined the relative effects of our experimental manipulations on white structural colour and yellow colour. Carotenoid availability directly affected yellow colour, while food availability affected it only in combination with carotenoid availability. None of our manipulations had significant effects on the expression of white structural colour. Our results suggest that the contribution of microstructures to variation in the expression of yellow coloration is less than the contribution of carotenoid content, and that carotenoid deposition is more dependent on extrinsic variability than is the production of white structural colour.",0.016550483,0.013944888,0.008228109,0.007338949,0.01718146,0.009827861,0.005836762,0.011956737,0.017564455,0.021198392,0.008441942,0.010381733,0.016703544,0.011722417,0.010954963,0.008482632,0.010737032,0.8925637,0.012789382,0.019289346,0.018697409,0.012323401,0.014541255,0.012909008,0.012552613,0.01358477,0.011414163,0.01380467,0.009968448,"['aplysia californica', 'sea hare', 'lagodon', 'bluehead', 'vertebrates', 'hares', 'sharks', 'fish', 'sphyrna', 'oxyjulis', 'sea hares', 'wrasses', 'fishes', 'bonnethead', 'lagodon rhomboides', 'sphyrna tiburo']","[0.012195121951219001, 0.048780487804878, 0.012195121951219001, 0.012195121951219001, 0.024390243902439, 0.048780487804878, 0.012195121951219001, 0.060975609756097005, 0.012195121951219001, 0.012195121951219001, 0.036585365853658, 0.024390243902439, 0.060975609756097005, 0.012195121951219001, 0.012195121951219001, 0.0]","[0.2, 0.8, 0.2, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 0.2, 1.0, 0.2, 0.2, 0.6000000000000001, 0.4, 1.0, 0.2, 0.2, 0.0]"

To this end, we analysed snapdragon flowers (Antirrhinum majus), including the mixta and nivea mutants, in controlled laboratory conditions using psychophysical tests with bumblebees. The MIXTA locus controls petal epidermal cell shape, and thus the path that incident light takes within the pigment-containing cells. The effect is that mixta mutant flowers are pink in comparison to the wild type purple flowers, and mutants lack the sparkling sheen of wild type flowers that is clearly visible to human observers. Despite their fundamentally different appearance to humans, and even though bees could discriminate the flowers, inexperienced bees exhibited no preference for either type, and the flowers did not differ in their detectability in a Y-maze—either when the flowers appeared in front of a homogeneous or a dappled background. Equally counterintuitive effects were found for the non-pigmented, UV reflecting nivea mutant: even though the overall reflectance intensity and UV signal of nivea flowers is several times that of wild type flowers, their detectability was significantly reduced relative to wild type flowers. In addition, naïve foragers preferred wild type flowers over nivea mutants, even though these generated a stronger signal in all receptor types.

The data provide additional insights into the unusually high cross-link density found in mature beaks. Furthermore, we propose both a low molecular weight catechol, and peptidyl-dopa, to be sclerotization agents of squid beak.

If proved to exist, such phenomena would hold considerable promise for agronomic improvement of staple food crops such as rice (Oryza sativa). • However, while substantiated by the presence of phytotoxic compounds at potentially relevant concentrations, demonstrating a direct role for specific natural products in allelopathy has been difficult because of the chemical complexity of root and plant litter exudates. This complexity can be bypassed via selective genetic manipulation to ablate production of putative allelopathic compounds, but such an approach previously has not been applied. • The rice diterpenoid momilactones provide an example of natural products for which correlative biochemical evidence has been obtained for a role in allelopathy. Here, we apply reverse genetics, using knock-outs of the relevant diterpene synthases (copalyl diphosphate synthase 4 (OsCPS4) and kaurene synthase-like 4 (OsKSL4)), to demonstrate that rice momilactones are involved in allelopathy, including suppressing growth of the widespread rice paddy weed, barnyard grass (Echinochloa crus-galli). • Thus, our results not only provide novel genetic evidence for natural product-mediated allelopathy, but also furnish a molecular target for breeding and metabolic engineering of this important crop plant.",0.007976082,0.007405366,0.005253374,0.005135292,0.010463011,0.006192837,0.008491219,0.005751555,0.007707633,0.009737561,0.011007459,0.009027289,0.010386966,0.007170999,0.006537447,0.009844551,0.00730433,0.006485476,0.006421315,0.007639965,0.010666164,0.010605331,0.007132635,0.008562519,0.008499172,0.93113446,0.006351946,0.011096999,0.007336323,[],[],[]

The second hypothesis claims that additional advantages will accrue if agroecosystems also maintain a substantial part of the diversity of natural systems. We test these hypotheses for the savannah zone of sub-Saharan Africa, with its low soil fertility and variable rainfall. Where annual food crops replace the natural grass understorey of savannah systems, water use will decrease and stream and groundwater flow change, unless tree density increases relative to the natural situation. Increasing tree density, however, will decrease crop yields, unless the trees meet specific criteria. Food crop production in the parkland systems may benefit from lower temperatures under tree canopies, but water use by trees providing this shade will prevent crops from benefiting. In old parkland trees that farmers have traditionally retained when opening fields for crops, water use per unit shade is less than in most fast growing trees introduced for agroforestry trials. Strong competition between plants adapted to years with different rainfall patterns may stabilise total system productivity -- but this will be appreciated by a farmer only if the components are of comparable value. The best precondition for farmers to maintain diversity in their agroecosystem hinges on the availability of a broad basket of choices, without clear winners or 'best bets'.",0.6613001,0.005338925,0.021435477,0.014039277,0.004615946,0.004421832,0.003496399,0.003558719,0.003292477,0.00908323,0.010977387,0.007566026,0.007986393,0.024912506,0.003544056,0.007374275,0.002911127,0.007057193,0.035224196,0.007458461,0.004026922,0.008513207,0.012053161,0.00341729,0.004985434,0.004869464,0.004850135,0.010916817,0.008740008,['camel'],[0.035294117647058004],[1.0]

Here, we provide a review of the current state of knowledge on the physics of gas exchange, insect respiratory chemoreceptors, the diversity and the methods typically used in the characterisation of respiratory pattern types, briefly covering some of the new tools and techniques that are being incorporated into this field. We then discuss the functional significance of insect gas exchange pattern variation, and possible evolutionary explanations of discontinuous gas exchange as a derived control mechanism for effecting physiological change in the context of (a) adaptive hypotheses, (b) non-adaptive hypotheses and (c) mathematical modelling of gas exchange. The lack of consensus in the literature for all proposed adaptive or mechanistic hypotheses suggests that multiple factors influence which gas exchange pattern is displayed by any particular insect during a given experiment. Thus, while the primary function of a breathing pattern is to meet an animal's gas exchange requirements, it is an interacting hierarchy of constraints that most likely determines how this demand may be met. We conclude the review with a brief discussion of future directions for the field.",0.106903195,0.002026952,0.004603516,0.003724243,0.004605817,0.002063171,0.003074709,0.00609422,0.004817835,0.005081802,0.007222612,0.00285697,0.014941646,0.004284748,0.003500808,0.007888315,0.003261718,0.010045604,0.010049859,0.004639575,0.003723281,0.003439164,0.009161469,0.003886743,0.002603565,0.003872576,0.001774339,0.006034263,0.003878113,"['phocoena phocoena', 'phocoena', 'flukes', 'harbor porpoise']","[0.0, 0.013698630136986, 0.027397260273972, 0.013698630136986]","[0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5]"

Computational and biological systems are often distributed so that processors (cells) jointly solve a task, without any of them receiving all inputs or observing all outputs. Maximal independent set (MIS) selection is a fundamental distributed computing procedure that seeks to elect a set of local leaders in a network. A variant of this problem is solved during the development of the fly’s nervous system, when sensory organ precursor (SOP) cells are chosen. By studying SOP selection, we derived a fast algorithm for MIS selection that combines two attractive features. First, processors do not need to know their degree; second, it has an optimal message complexity while only using one-bit messages.

Each seta branches into hundreds of 200-nm spatulae that make intimate contact with a variety of surface profiles. We showed previously that the combined surface area of billions of spatulae maximizes van der Waals interactions to generate large adhesive and shear forces. Geckos are not known to groom their feet yet retain their stickiness for months between molts. How geckos manage to keep their feet clean while walking about with sticky toes has remained a puzzle until now. Although self-cleaning by water droplets occurs in plant and animal surfaces, no adhesive has been shown to self-clean. In the present study, we demonstrate that gecko setae are a self-cleaning adhesive. Geckos with dirty feet recovered their ability to cling to vertical surfaces after only a few steps. Self-cleaning occurred in arrays of setae isolated from the gecko. Contact mechanical models suggest that self-cleaning occurs by an energetic disequilibrium between the adhesive forces attracting a dirt particle to the substrate and those attracting the same particle to one or more spatulae. We propose that the property of self-cleaning is intrinsic to the setal nanostructure and therefore should be replicable in synthetic adhesive materials in the future.",0.034319334,0.019946432,0.030331578,0.021307588,0.017931908,0.020677062,0.020187512,0.025952533,0.031208012,0.8697213,0.023184147,0.048834138,0.023660395,0.01781042,0.03976195,0.02730345,0.011766166,0.030412372,0.04453364,0.044232503,0.015789185,0.012509942,0.034449987,0.030638015,0.04085247,0.048736956,0.050836273,0.87549776,0.047396608,['cnidarians'],[0.028571428571428],[1.0]

Unlike marine mammals, they start their aquatic life as 40–50 g hatchlings, so undergo a 10,000-fold increase in body mass during independent existence. Hatchlings are limited to the tropics and near-surface water. Adults, obligate predators on gelatinous plankton, encounter cold water at depth (<1280 m) or high latitude and are gigantotherms that maintain elevated core body temperatures in cold water. This study shows that there are great ontogenetic changes in tracheal structure related to diving and exposure to cold. Hatchling leatherbacks have a conventional reptilian tracheal structure with circular cartilaginous rings interspersed with extensive connective tissue. The adult trachea is an almost continuous ellipsoidal cartilaginous tube composed of interlocking plates, and will collapse easily in the upper part of the water column during dives, thus avoiding pressure-related structural and physiological problems. It is lined with an extensive, dense erectile vascular plexus that will warm and humidify cold inspired air and possibly retain heat on expiration. A sub-luminal lymphatic plexus is also present. Mammals and birds have independently evolved nasal turbinates to fulfil such a respiratory thermocontrol function; for them, turbinates are regarded as diagnostic of endothermy. This is the first demonstration of a turbinate equivalent in a living reptile.",0.024757953,0.036458213,0.03657717,0.010966412,0.7733258,0.83814764,0.075304955,0.026516901,0.089162126,0.022759942,0.03588736,0.006481228,0.0198771,0.012605989,0.028843077,0.02790755,0.06308557,0.02418878,0.015217914,0.05265762,0.060713906,0.011056117,0.80856603,0.023647325,0.05018964,0.022008723,0.06899283,0.01892831,0.048240058,"['bird', 'birds', 'mammals']","[0.052631578947368, 0.052631578947368, 0.026315789473684]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.5]"

Antler bone is much tougher than 'ordinary' bone and its failure properties have been investigated in: (i) monotonic tensile tests and (ii) creep rupture experiments. Tensile fatigue is another way of examining how damage develops in bone. The development of damage in the present fatigue tests was non-linear with the cycle number, the degree of non-linearity was dependent on the level of stress and followed a clearly different course for bone and antler. Antler was a more damage-tolerant material, being able to achieve a reduction in the final modulus of elasticity, just prior to failure, three times greater than 'ordinary' bone. The evolution of damage is quantified by an empirical and a graphical method and by the use of Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM) expressions.

In shell constructions, joints between individual elements are considered as weak points, yet these echinoid skeletons show an extensive preservation potential in both Recent and fossil environments. The remarkable strength of the test is achieved by skeletal reinforcement structures and their constructional layouts. Micro-computed tomography and scanning electron microscopy are used for microstructural and volumetric analyses of the echinoid's skeleton. It is shown that strengthening mechanisms act on different hierarchical levels from the overall shape of the skeleton to skeletal interlocking. The tight-fitting and interlocking plate joints lead to a shell considered to behave as a monolithic structure. The plate's architecture features distinct regions interpreted as a significant load-transferring system. The internal support system follows the segmentation of the remaining skeleton, where sutural layout and stereom distribution are designed for effective load transfer. The structural analysis of the multi-plated, yet monolithic skeleton of Echinocyamus pusillus reveals new aspects of the micro-morphology and its structural relevance for the load-bearing behaviour.

Two categories of pigments, flavonoids and dearomatized isoprenylated phloroglucinols (DIPs), are responsible for the UV demarcations of this flower. Flavonoids had been shown previously to function as floral UV pigments, but DIPs had not been demonstrated to serve in that capacity. We found the DIPs to be present in high concentration in the anthers and ovarian wall of the flower, suggesting that the compounds also serve in defense. Indeed, feeding tests done with one of the DIPs (hypercalin A) showed the compound to be deterrent and toxic to a caterpillar (Utetheisa ornatrix). The possibility that floral UV pigments fulfill both a visual and a defensive function had not previously been contemplated.

The location and frequency of conical cells have led to speculation that they play a role in attracting animal pollinators. Snapdragon (Antirrhinum) mutants lacking conical cells have been shown to be discriminated against by foraging bumblebees. Here we investigated the extent to which a difference in petal surface structure influences pollinator behavior through touch-based discrimination. To isolate touch-based responses, we used both biomimetic replicas of petal surfaces and isogenic Antirrhinum lines differing only in petal epidermal cell shape. We show that foraging bumblebees are able to discriminate between different surfaces via tactile cues alone. We find that bumblebees use color cues to discriminate against flowers that lack conical cells--but only when flower surfaces are presented at steep angles, making them difficult to manipulate.

The spawn is moulded and fixed to flat or convex surfaces by the female’s ventral pedal gland, during an hours-long process in which the female adopts a stereotyped posture and appears nonreactive to most external stimuli. Microscopically, the different cells of the ventral pedal gland show features suggesting their participation in the secretion of both the organic matrix and the calcium component of the calcareous layer. The latter consists mainly of numerous spherspherulites that are packed together around cylindrical, septated spaces which traverse the spherspherulitic layer and attach to the membranous layers surrounding the capsule cavity. These septated spaces should ensure permeability of the capsule wall, which is necessary for gas exchange and excretion by the embryo. The calcareous layer is made of high-magnesium calcite, a calcium carbonate polymorph in which Ca is partially substituted by Mg in the calcite lattice. Mg substitution is thought to confer a greater crack resistance to the mineral; it is found in many invertebrates, but apparently has not been reported before in molluscs.

One is an actively released chemical defense: an ink secretion that is a mixture of two glandular products—ink from the ink gland and opaline from the opaline gland. The mechanisms of action of ink secretion and its components have recently been examined in detail against several predatory invertebrates. Our goal is to extend this mechanistic analysis to predatory vertebrates. Toward this end, the current study details the effects of ink, opaline, and one set of its components—the products of the reaction of escapin, an l-amino acid oxidase, with its natural substrates, l-lysine and l-arginine—on the palatability of food for five species of fishes: bluehead wrasses Thalassoma bifasciatum, señorita wrasses Oxyjulis californica, pinfish Lagodon rhomboides, mummichogs Fundulus heteroclitus, and bonnethead sharks Sphyrna tiburo. These fishes have different feeding styles, ranging from large fishes able to engulf sea hares to smaller fishes able to attack sea hares by pecking at them; and they live in a variety of habitats, including those that sea hares typically inhabit. We show that ink but not opaline significantly decreases the palatability of food for all five species, and that escapin products are mildly unpalatable to the two species of wrasses but not to the other species.

We find that bdelloids are also extraordinarily resistant to ionizing radiation (IR). Reproduction of the bdelloids Adineta vaga and Philodina roseola is much more resistant to IR than that of Euchlanis dilatata, a rotifer belonging to the desiccation-intolerant and facultatively sexual class Monogononta, and all other animals for which we have found relevant data. By analogy with the desiccation- and radiation-resistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans, we suggest that the extraordinary radiation resistance of bdelloid rotifers is a consequence of their evolutionary adaptation to survive episodes of desiccation encountered in their characteristic habitats and that the damage incurred in such episodes includes DNA breakage that is repaired upon rehydration. Such breakage and repair may have maintained bdelloid chromosomes as colinear pairs and kept the load of transposable genetic elements low and may also have contributed to the success of bdelloid rotifers in avoiding the early extinction suffered by most asexuals.",0.017628122,0.008533016,0.011456289,0.012575644,0.006605129,0.008918715,0.006940051,0.028364949,0.03260554,0.028600553,0.010309293,0.91918117,0.008584121,0.008921443,0.009592816,0.022556433,0.007297899,0.011099134,0.0204052,0.012318289,0.015429933,0.021320593,0.015040332,0.022889787,0.01065142,0.022815023,0.004202707,0.011523646,0.014962603,['diomedea'],[0.015151515151515001],[1.0]

Moreover, they move so quickly that energy must be stored before a jump and then released suddenly. High speed imaging and analysis of the mechanics of the proximal joints of the hind legs show that mechanical mechanisms ensure both synchrony of movements and energy storage. The hind trochantera move first in jumping and are synchronised to within 30 μs. Synchrony is achieved by mechanical interactions between small protrusions from each trochantera which fluoresce bright blue under specific wavelengths of ultra-violet light and which touch at the midline when the legs are cocked before a jump. In dead Issus, a depression force applied to a cocked hind leg, or to the tendon of its trochanteral depressor muscle causes a simultaneous depression of both hind legs. The protrusion of the hind leg that moves first nudges the other hind leg so that both move synchronously. Contractions of the trochanteral depressor muscles that precede a jump bend the metathoracic pleural arches of the internal skeleton. Large areas of these bow-shaped structures fluoresce bright blue in ultraviolet light, and the intensity of this fluorescence depends on the pH of the bathing saline. These are key signatures of the rubber-like protein resilin. The remainder of a pleural arch consists of stiff cuticle. Bending these composite structures stores energy and their recoil powers jumping.",0.012919658,0.013781884,0.019101016,0.01103715,0.02214918,0.033223353,0.019682176,0.008746711,0.012384333,0.010630393,0.006154243,0.009921803,0.015316579,0.023763642,0.009287969,0.007400971,0.90276986,0.01676997,0.01704562,0.019186616,0.021144684,0.03133105,0.03069153,0.018924037,0.01318303,0.012671039,0.009149862,0.007763022,0.02783042,['brassica nigra'],[0.0],[0]

Air conditioning, for example, accounts for nearly fifteen per cent of the primary energy used by buildings in the United States. A passive cooling strategy that cools without any electricity input could therefore have a significant impact on global energy consumption. To achieve cooling one needs to be able to reach and maintain a temperature below that of the ambient air. At night, passive cooling below ambient air temperature has been demonstrated using a technique known as radiative cooling, in which a device exposed to the sky is used to radiate heat to outer space through a transparency window in the atmosphere between 8 and 13 micrometres. Peak cooling demand, however, occurs during the daytime. Daytime radiative cooling to a temperature below ambient of a surface under direct sunlight has not been achieved because sky access during the day results in heating of the radiative cooler by the Sun. Here, we experimentally demonstrate radiative cooling to nearly 5 degrees Celsius below the ambient air temperature under direct sunlight. Using a thermal photonic approach, we introduce an integrated photonic solar reflector and thermal emitter consisting of seven layers of HfO2 and SiO2 that reflects 97 per cent of incident sunlight while emitting strongly and selectively in the atmospheric transparency window. When exposed to direct sunlight exceeding 850 watts per square metre on a rooftop, the photonic radiative cooler cools to 4.9 degrees Celsius below ambient air temperature, and has a cooling power of 40.1 watts per square metre at ambient air temperature. These results demonstrate that a tailored, photonic approach can fundamentally enable new technological possibilities for energy efficiency.

By using a quorum threshold, namely the number of ants within a new nest site, to determine their choice, the ants are in effect voting with their feet. Our results show that such quorum sensing is compatible with homogenization theory such that the average value of a new nest site is determined by ants accumulating within it when the nest site is of high quality and leaving when it is poor.

Camels were kept under desert conditions and deprived of drinking water. In the daytime the exhaled air was at or near body core temperature, while in the cooler night exhaled air was at or near ambient air temperature. In the daytime the exhaled air was fully saturated, but at night its humidity might fall to approximately 75% r. h. The combination of cooling and desaturation can provide a saving of water of 60% relative to exhalation of saturated air at body temperature. The mechanism responsible for cooling of the exhaled air is a simple heat exchange between the respiratory air and the surfaces of the nasal passageways. On inhalation these surfaces are cooled by the air passing over them, and on exhalation heat from the exhaled air is given off to these cooler surfaces. The mechanism responsible for desaturation of the air appears to depend on the hygroscopic properties of the nasal surfaces when the camel is dehydrated. The surfaces give off water vapour during inhalation and take up water from the respiratory air during exhalation.

Blubber is a pliant biocomposite formed by adipocytes and structural fibers composed of collagen and elastic fibers. Caudal keels are dorsally and ventrally placed triangular wedges of blubber that define the hydrodynamic profile of the porpoise tailstock. Mechanical tests on carcasses demonstrate that when keels are bent, they strain nonuniformly along their lengths, with highest strains just caudal to the dorsal fin and lowest at the insertion of the flukes. Therefore, caudal keels undergo nonuniform longitudinal deformation while maintaining a stable, triangular cross‐sectional shape. Polarizing and transmitted light microscopy techniques were used to investigate blubber's 3D fiber architecture along the length of the dorsal keel. The triangular cross‐sectional shape of the keel appears to be maintained by structural fibers oriented to act as tensile stays. The construction of the blubber composite is regionally specific :structural fiber densities and diameters are higher in the relatively stiff caudal region of the keel than in the more deformable cranial keel region. The orientations of structural fibers also change along the length of the keel. Cranially, no fibers are oriented along the long axis, whereas a novel population of longitudinally oriented fibers reinforces the keel at the insertion of the flukes. Thus, differences in the distribution and orientation of structural fibers contribute to the regionally specific mechanical properties of the dorsal keel. J.

The toucan's bill has been interpreted as a sexual ornament and as an adaptation for handling fruit. Tattersall et al. (p. 468) explore an alternative explanation in which the bill serves primarily as a thermoregulator. Infrared thermography techniques, which allow detailed observations with minimal disturbance to the birds, show that the birds alter blood flow to the bill according to ambient conditions, effectively using it as a radiator to “dump heat.” Toucans alter blood flow to their massive bills according to ambient conditions. The toco toucan (Ramphastos toco), the largest member of the toucan family, possesses the largest beak relative to body size of all birds. This exaggerated feature has received various interpretations, from serving as a sexual ornament to being a refined adaptation for feeding. However, it is also a significant surface area for heat exchange. Here we show the remarkable capacity of the toco toucan to regulate heat distribution by modifying blood flow, using the bill as a transient thermal radiator.

While this process is still not completely understood, the medical literature includes several reports of “oral stinging” (i.e., punctured wounds in the human oral cavity) following consumption of raw male squid, which contains undischarged spermatophores able to inflict such wounds. Here, we revisit a recent medical report of oral stinging by Shiraki et al. (Pathol Int 61:749–751, 2011), providing an in-depth reanalysis of their histological biopsies and revealing vital information on the functioning of squid spermatophores. The morphology of the spermatangia attached within the oral cavity is similar to the condition found in spermatangia naturally attached to female squids. The spermatangia were able to superficially puncture the superficial layers of the oral stratified squamous epithelium, and numerous, minute stellate particles from the squid spermatophore were found adhered to the oral epithelium. These findings corroborate previous hypotheses on the functioning of squid spermatophores, namely that spermatophore attachment generally involves tissue scarification, and that stellate particles play a vital role in the attachment process. Moreover, spermatophore attachment is confirmed to be autonomous (i.e., performed by the spermatophore itself) in another squid species (possibly a loliginid), and the results strongly indicate that the attachment mechanism is not dependent upon a specialized epithelium, nor a mate’s specific chemical stimulus. From the pathological point of view, the best prophylactic measure at present is the removal of the internal organs of the raw squid prior to its consumption.",0.011564417,0.012104599,0.009879706,0.009150035,0.019057477,0.009364468,0.00868528,0.014159315,0.027666306,0.03826541,0.007752221,0.007836209,0.018682217,0.009893826,0.91188204,0.01338628,0.008828729,0.011962665,0.00920342,0.008971893,0.01483059,0.006978412,0.008191988,0.04093023,0.006028892,0.008470682,0.016459543,0.011233438,0.009972337,[],[],[]

In such systems individual cells can switch to an alternative state and, after some time, switch back again. In Bacillus subtilis, competence is an example of such a transiently differentiated state associated with the capability for DNA uptake from the environment. Individual genes and proteins underlying differentiation into the competent state have been identified, but it has been unclear how these genes interact dynamically in individual cells to control both spontaneous entry into competence and return to vegetative growth. Here we show that this behaviour can be understood in terms of excitability in the underlying genetic circuit. Using quantitative fluorescence time-lapse microscopy, we directly observed the activities of multiple circuit components simultaneously in individual cells, and analysed the resulting data in terms of a mathematical model. We find that an excitable core module containing positive and negative feedback loops can explain both entry into, and exit from, the competent state. We further tested this model by analysing initiation in sister cells, and by re-engineering the gene circuit to specifically block exit. Excitable dynamics driven by noise naturally generate stochastic and transient responses, thereby providing an ideal mechanism for competence regulation.",0.027125483,0.010856863,0.013820292,0.024669232,0.005976596,0.005852096,0.005594276,0.015114769,0.03357462,0.024171637,0.025456524,0.4596627,0.020261865,0.015193664,0.015036172,0.007216717,0.006028191,0.009649151,0.08080533,0.005910817,0.011800313,0.17622899,0.009384958,0.019406212,0.006169624,0.24543199,0.004896332,0.015006465,0.005083924,"['bacteria', 'shewanella oneidensis']","[0.010204081632653001, 0.010204081632653001]","[1.0, 1.0]"

Recent work demonstrated that individual starlings within large flocks respond to a fixed number of nearest neighbors, but until now it was not understood why this number is seven. We analyze robustness to uncertainty of consensus in empirical data from multiple starling flocks and show that the flock interaction networks with six or seven neighbors optimize the trade-off between group cohesion and individual effort. We can distinguish these numbers of neighbors from fewer or greater numbers using our systems-theoretic approach to measuring robustness of interaction networks as a function of the network structure, i.e., who is sensing whom. The metric quantifies the disagreement within the network due to disturbances and noise during consensus behavior and can be evaluated over a parameterized family of hypothesized sensing strategies (here the parameter is number of neighbors). We use this approach to further show that for the range of flocks studied the optimal number of neighbors does not depend on the number of birds within a flock; rather, it depends on the shape, notably the thickness, of the flock. The results suggest that robustness to uncertainty may have been a factor in the evolution of flocking for starlings.

In this study we used immunochemical, electrophysiological, and neuroanatomical techniques to investigate the function of the Pd5 neurons, the largest magnetically responsive cells. Immunocytochemical studies localized TPeps, neuropeptides isolated from Pd5, to dense-cored vesicles within the Pd5 somata and within neurites adjacent to ciliated foot epithelial cells. Anatomical analyses revealed that neurites from Pd5 are located within nerves innervating the ipsilateral foot and body wall.

The evolution of flight in small insects was accompanied by striking adaptations of the thoracic musculature that enabled very high wing beat frequencies. At the cellular and protein filament level, a stretch activation mechanism evolved that allowed high-oscillatory work to be achieved at very high frequencies as contraction and nerve stimulus became asynchronous. At the molecular level, critical adaptations occurred within the motor protein myosin II, because its elementary interactions with actin set the speed of sarcomere contraction. Here, we show that the key myosin enzymatic adaptations required for powering the very fast flight muscles in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster include the highest measured detachment rate of myosin from actin (forward rate constant, 3,698 s−1), an exceptionally weak affinity of MgATP for myosin (association constant, 0.2 mM−1), and a unique rate-limiting step in the cross-bridge cycle at the point of inorganic phosphate release. The latter adaptations are constraints imposed by the overriding requirement for exceptionally fast release of the hydrolytic product MgADP. Otherwise, as in Drosophila embryonic muscle and other slow muscle types, a step associated with MgADP release limits muscle contraction speed by delaying the detachment of myosin from actin.",0.011183566,0.011856187,0.0150958,0.00827928,0.021102196,0.022292202,0.016843816,0.00758713,0.011671395,0.009533191,0.004478835,0.007895577,0.012632012,0.020685112,0.009745565,0.005602954,0.8464973,0.012334427,0.012614789,0.016679408,0.019734738,0.016976515,0.024633357,0.012148841,0.009130325,0.009377495,0.006239757,0.007167476,0.019799192,"['beetles', 'plants']","[0.051282051282051, 0.025641025641025002]","[1.0, 0.5]"

The current hypothesis proposes that the development of gravitropic bending is correlated with a redistribution of [Ca2+]i in gravistimulated roots. However, no study has demonstrated clearly the development of an asymmetry of this ion during root curvature. We tested this hypothesis by quantifying the temporal and spatial changes in [Ca2+]i in roots of living Arabidopsis seedlings using ultraviolet-confocal Ca2+-ratio imaging and vertical stage fluorescence microscopy to visualize root [Ca2+]i. We observed no changes in [Ca2+]i associated with the graviresponse whether monitored at the whole organ level or in individual cells in different regions of the root for up to 12 h after gravistimulation. However, touch stimulation led to transient increases in [Ca2+]i in all cell types monitored. The increases induced in the cap cells were larger and longer-lived than in cells in the meristematic or elongation zone. One millimolar La3+ and 100 [mu]M verapamil did not prevent these responses, whereas 5 mM EGTA or 50 [mu]M ruthenium red inhibited the transients, indicating an intracellular origin of the Ca2+ increase.

In long-lived vertebrates, reproductive output usually increases during early adulthood, but it is difficult to disentangle the roles of development and learning on this gain of reproductive success. Lekking lance-tailed manakins provide an opportunity to separate these processes, as the vast majority of male reproduction occurs after a bird obtains alpha status and maintains a display area in the lek, but the age at which males achieve alpha status varies widely. Using 11 years of longitudinal data on age, social status and genetic siring success, I assessed the factors influencing variation in siring success by individuals over their lifetimes. The data show increases in annual reproductive success with both age and alpha experience. At advanced ages, these gains were offset by senescence in fecundity. Individual ontogeny, rather than compositional change of the population, generated a nonlinear relationship of breeding tenure with lifetime success; age of assuming alpha status was unrelated to tenure as a breeder, or success in the alpha role. Importantly, these findings suggest that social experience can mitigate the negative effects of senescence in older breeders.",0.007365536,0.004929792,0.04533225,0.007979788,0.010185323,0.010248762,0.007155705,0.009280552,0.029329432,0.048789892,0.005497379,0.14083424,0.005295529,0.010084183,0.003881579,0.006511962,0.01361071,0.01514779,0.07334025,0.00544517,0.012356003,0.091325186,0.023259966,0.01006718,0.007729315,0.008651524,0.002634192,0.005843001,0.008156423,[],[],[]

This coordination can become further complicated when individuals within a group face conflicts of interest. We experimentally induced symmetrical conflicts of interest over which direction to choose in meerkat, Suricata suricatta, groups. We trained dominant and subordinate individuals to expect food at locations in opposite directions when the group was still at its sleeping burrow (i.e. before the group started foraging). Trained individuals were more likely to initiate group departure in the direction of their rewarded location and there was no difference between dominants and subordinates in initiation rate. Initiation of group departure seemed to be the most important factor determining the final direction of the group, as the direction chosen by the first initiator was rarely challenged. We did not observe any obvious signals used to enhance recruitment during this process. Over the experimental days, initiator identity changed suggesting that individual motivation to initiate group departure varies from day to day. Meerkats voluntarily avoided immediate foraging benefits to maintain cohesion with the group, which probably prevented them from incurring costs associated with becoming isolated.

In general, productivity of natural vegetation under savannah trees increases as rainfall decreases, while the opposite occurs in agroforestry. One explanation is that in the savannah, the beneficial effects of microclimatic improvements (e.g. lower temperatures and evaporation losses) are greater in more xeric environments. Mature savannah trees have a high proportion of woody above-ground structure compared to foliage, so that the amount of water 'saved' (largely by reduction in soil evaporation) is greater than water 'lost' through transpiration by trees. By contrast, in agroforestry practices such as alley cropping where tree density is high, any beneficial effects of the trees on microclimate are negated by reductions in soil moisture due to increasing interception losses and tree transpiration. While investment in woody structure can improve the water economy beneath agroforestry trees, it inevitably reduces the growth rate of the trees and thus increases the time required for improved understorey productivity. Therefore, agroforesters prefer trees with more direct and immediate benefits to farmers. The greatest opportunity for simultaneous agroforestry practices is therefore to fill niches within the landscape where resources are currently under-utilised by crops. In this way, agroforestry can mimic the large scale patch dynamics and successional progression of a natural ecosystem.",0.8439044,0.005767275,0.011964891,0.009664875,0.005806079,0.005203752,0.00479679,0.003498556,0.003104556,0.010332994,0.010093602,0.008836247,0.007620042,0.014573365,0.006357423,0.016012227,0.003552652,0.007759677,0.024126273,0.01088948,0.006051969,0.00538143,0.019419925,0.00447441,0.006211642,0.005206875,0.004368324,0.009691483,0.010029201,[],[],[]

To address the relative contributions of different geochemistries to the energy demands of these ecosystems, we draw together three lines of inference. We studied the phylogenetic compositions of high-temperature (>70 degrees C) communities in Yellowstone hot springs with distinct chemistries, conducted parallel chemical analyses, and carried out thermodynamic modeling. Results of extensive molecular analyses, taken with previous results, show that most microbial biomass in these systems, as reflected by rRNA gene abundance, is comprised of organisms of the kinds that derive energy for primary productivity from the oxidation of molecular hydrogen, H2. The apparent dominance by H2-metabolizing organisms indicates that H2 is the main source of energy for primary production in the Yellowstone high-temperature ecosystem. Hydrogen concentrations in the hot springs were measured and found to range up to >300 nM, consistent with this hypothesis.

Previous studies have focused mainly on understanding the venom's role in prey capture but successful prey capture requires both rapid physiological and biomechanical mechanisms. Conus catus, a fish-hunting species, uses a high-speed hydraulic mechanism to inject its hollow, spear-like radular tooth into prey. We take an integrated approach to investigating the biomechanics of this process by coupling kinematic studies with morphological analyses. Taking advantage of the opaque venom and translucent proboscis of a mollusc-hunting juvenile cone snail, Conus pennaceus, we have determined that a high-speed prey capture mechanism is not unique to cone species that hunt fish prey. Two morphological structures were found to play crucial roles in this process. A constriction of the lumen near the tip of the proboscis, composed of tall epithelial cells densely packed with microfilaments, impedes forward movement of the radular tooth prior to its propulsion. Proximal to the constriction, a muscular sphincter was found to regulate venom flow and pressurization in the proboscis. In C. pennaceus, the rapid appearance and flushing of venom within the proboscis during prey capture suggests a mechanism involving the delivery of a discrete quantity of venom. The interplay between these elements provides a unique and effective biomechanical injection system for the fast-acting cone snail venom peptides.",0.7832593,0.01599293,0.028339157,0.02890607,0.018308174,0.039664797,0.008234139,0.017274925,0.011309285,0.91093796,0.013747123,0.028584918,0.016163312,0.030393522,0.03925563,0.015211141,0.010574649,0.028425846,0.061601553,0.0385951,0.008230079,0.025373653,0.007960229,0.026936514,0.020089537,0.022550479,0.015443479,0.037150018,0.041445438,"['solifugae', 'eremochelis bilobatus', 'arachnida']","[0.038461538461538006, 0.038461538461538006, 0.038461538461538006]","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0]"

Metal reduction kinetics have been studied in cultures of dissimilatory metal reducing bacteria which include the Shewanella oneidensis strain MR-1. Estimation of system parameters from time-series data faces obstructions in the implementation depending on the choice of the mathematical model that captures the observed dynamics. The modeling of metal reduction is often based on Michaelis-Menten equations. These models are often developed using initial in vitro reaction rates and seldom match with in vivo reduction profiles.


RESULTS
For metal reduction studies, we propose a model that is based on the power law representation that is effectively applied to the kinetics of metal reduction. The method yields reasonable parameter estimates and is illustrated with the analysis of time-series data that describes the dynamics of metal reduction in S.oneidensis strain MR-1. In addition, mixed metal studies involving the reduction of Uranyl (U(VI)) to the relatively insoluble tetravalent form (U(IV)) by S. alga strain (BR-Y) were studied in the presence of environmentally relevant iron hydrous oxides. For mixed metals, parameter estimation and curve fitting are accomplished with a generalized least squares formulation that handles systems of ordinary differential equations and is implemented in Matlab. It consists of an optimization algorithm (Levenberg-Marquardt, LSQCURVEFIT) and a numerical ODE solver. Simulation with the estimated parameters indicates that the model captures the experimental data quite well. The model uses the estimated parameters to predict the reduction rates of metals and mixed metals at varying concentrations.

Although the lipid content decreased significantly during this period, metabolic water production was insufficient to maintain total body water. Rehydration (no food) resulted in increases in body weight and haemolymph volume (sub-normal), and total body water to normality. Haemolymph osmolality, sodium, potassium and chloride concentrations increased during dehydration, but despite a marked decrease in the volume of haemolymph, changes in these parameters were subject to osmoregulatory control. Protein concentrations increased during dehydration and decreased during rehydration. Rapid rehydration (1 h) is well-controlled: while haemolymph volume increased dramatically, haemolymph osmolality, sodium, potassium and chloride were strongly regulated. However, extended rehydration (over 4 days) appears not to be as well managed by Physadesmia, with haemolymph osmolality and sodium concentrations decreasing despite no significant change in haemolymph volume from immediate post-rehydration (1 h) values. The potassium and chloride concentrations, however, appeared to be under stricter control during this period.

The cochlear nerve fibers code this information and convey it to the brain for further processing. This study investigates the performance of the system inner hair cell – primary auditory afferent nerve fibers at the physical limit of the mechano-electrical transduction for the human auditory frequency range. The Brownian motion of the hair cell’s receptive organelle, the hair bundle, does not blunt the sensitivity, but in fact enlarges – especially in frequency regions which are most important for the perception of music and speech – via the mechanism of nonlinear stochastic resonance (SR) the dynamical range of the mechano-electrical transduction by at least one order of magnitude. The coding efficiency of small sinusoidal hair bundle deflections shows basic properties of the human hearing threshold curve for pure tones and corresponds to experimental results of noise-induced tuning curves in mechano-receptors in the rat foot. Furthermore, the model explains how altered coding efficiency contributes to pathological changes in the spiking pattern which arise from morphological changes in the hair bundle structure (e.g., in noise-induced sensorineural hearing loss of cochlear origin).",0.015284011,0.07570804,0.020127848,0.07113412,0.008009398,0.008841415,0.007821604,0.011223502,0.02541309,0.009264118,0.010072756,0.024913011,0.01811591,0.010386407,0.007950301,0.006811405,0.03267766,0.030000241,0.012581656,0.01075564,0.012323001,0.8255672,0.008161971,0.015233064,0.006715265,0.015596776,0.006587518,0.007030213,0.010949698,[],[],[]

The complexity of some eusocial insect societies appears to arise from self-organized task allocation and group cohesion. One of the best-supported models explaining self-organized task allocation in social insects is the response threshold model, which predicts specialization due to inter-individual variability in sensitivity to task-associated stimuli. The model explains foraging task specialization among honeybee workers, but the factors underlying the differences in individual sensitivity remain elusive. Here, we propose that in honeybees, sensory sensitivity correlates with individual differences in the number of sensory structures, as it does in solitary species. Examining European and Africanized honeybees, we introduce and test the hypothesis that body size and/or sensory allometry is associated with foraging task preferences and resource exploitation. We focus on common morphological measures and on the size and number of structures associated with olfactory sensitivity. We show that the number of olfactory sensilla is greater in pollen and water foragers, which are known to exhibit higher sensory sensitivity, compared to nectar foragers. These differences are independent of the distribution of size within a colony. Our data also suggest that body mass and number of olfactory sensilla correlate with the concentration of nectar gathered by workers, and with the size of pollen loads they carry. We conclude that sensory allometry, but not necessarily body size, is associated with resource exploitation in honeybees and that the differences in number of sensilla may underlie the observed differences in sensitivity between bees specialized on water, pollen and nectar collection.",0.020345343,0.019645479,0.008271019,0.8245093,0.005805008,0.013796888,0.006809924,0.014437143,0.010479524,0.024277471,0.026240407,0.022040844,0.026880223,0.08301326,0.018651366,0.005249498,0.007362653,0.014885134,0.010623518,0.009477952,0.015009228,0.04656079,0.02339737,0.01073575,0.012659948,0.007822151,0.006259127,0.016627839,0.014845624,"['macrotermes michaelseni', 'macrotermes', 'termites']","[0.0, 0.022727272727272003, 0.022727272727272003]","[0.0, 1.0, 1.0]"

Chief among such adaptations is the ability to detect infrared radiation as a means of locating hotspots on warm-blooded prey. Among vertebrates, only vampire bats, boas, pythons and pit vipers are capable of detecting infrared radiation. In each case, infrared signals are detected by trigeminal nerve fibres that innervate specialized pit organs on the animal’s face. Thus, vampire bats and snakes have taken thermosensation to the extreme by developing specialized systems for detecting infrared radiation. As such, these creatures provide a window into the molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying evolutionary tuning of thermoreceptors in a species-specific or cell-type-specific manner. Previously, we have shown that snakes co-opt a non-heat-sensitive channel, vertebrate TRPA1 (transient receptor potential cation channel A1), to produce an infrared detector. Here we show that vampire bats tune a channel that is already heat-sensitive, TRPV1, by lowering its thermal activation threshold to about 30 °C. This is achieved through alternative splicing of TRPV1 transcripts to produce a channel with a truncated carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic domain. These splicing events occur exclusively in trigeminal ganglia, and not in dorsal root ganglia, thereby maintaining a role for TRPV1 as a detector of noxious heat in somatic afferents. This reflects a unique organization of the bat Trpv1 gene that we show to be characteristic of Laurasiatheria mammals (cows, dogs and moles), supporting a close phylogenetic relationship with bats. These findings reveal a novel molecular mechanism for physiological tuning of thermosensory nerve fibres.",0.010822363,0.043441866,0.006477659,0.019500239,0.00555819,0.013661351,0.006832705,0.004518891,0.005886493,0.008670422,0.011887148,0.004782382,0.007605751,0.008314163,0.003597357,0.007963765,0.008251095,0.011873612,0.005023952,0.008115445,0.00831754,0.015728943,0.87942785,0.00314371,0.008036335,0.008107584,0.005796318,0.007978361,0.008685124,"['python', 'burmese python']","[0.042857142857142004, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0]"

A momentum–impulse approach,"SUMMARY Frogs are animals that are capable of locomotion in two physically different media, aquatic and terrestrial. A comparison of the kinematics of swimming frogs in a previous study revealed a difference in propulsive impulse between jumping and swimming. To explore this difference further, we determined the instantaneous forces during propulsion in swimming using an impulse–momentum approach based on DPIV flow data. The force profile obtained was compared with force profiles obtained from drag–thrust equilibrium of the centre of mass and with the force profiles generated during jumping. The new approach to quantifying the instantaneous forces during swimming was tested and proved to be a valid method for determining the external forces on the feet of swimming frogs. On the kinematic profiles of swimming, leg extension precedes propulsion. This means that it is not only the acceleration of water backwards that provides thrust, but also that the deceleration of water flowing towards the frog as a result of recovery accelerates the centre of mass prior to leg extension. The force profile obtained from the impulse–momentum approach exposed an overestimation of drag by 30% in the drag–thrust calculations. This means that the difference in impulse between jumping and swimming in frogs is even larger than previously stated. The difference between the force profiles, apart from a slightly higher peak force during jumping, lies mainly in a difference in shape. During swimming, maximal force is reached early in the extension phase, 20% into it, while during jumping, peak force is attained at 80% of the extension phase. This difference is caused by a difference in inter-limb coordination.",0.015322145,0.013823777,0.011042627,0.00954358,0.010356103,0.8479463,0.00402324,0.008570598,0.0439583,0.013324515,0.014133292,0.006877372,0.009536573,0.006415604,0.005403457,0.004332376,0.011253412,0.00654126,0.004228197,0.05108789,0.007860603,0.007148726,0.024973143,0.01586971,0.007775153,0.011187775,0.009004854,0.005096034,0.014328381,['insects'],[0.022222222222222],[1.0]

This biopolymer network is also crucial for processes that require spatial and temporal variations in the network structure such as cell migration, division and intracellular transport. The cytoskeleton therefore has to combine structural integrity and mechanical stability with the possibility of fast and efficient network reorganization and restructuring. Cells meet this challenge by using proteins to link filamentous actin (F-actin) and construct complex networks. The molecular properties of the cross-linking proteins determine to a large extent the (micro)structure, viscoelastic properties and dynamics of the resulting networks. This review focuses on the structural polymorphism that can be induced by cross-linking proteins in reconstituted F-actin networks and summarizes recent results on how the molecular properties of cross-linking proteins dictate the ensuing viscoelastic properties.",0.016067142,0.014023352,0.06715925,0.011112713,0.81441945,0.012706463,0.024692297,0.8597314,0.025859965,0.027493382,0.019924259,0.028387165,0.020751497,0.016360473,0.022049075,0.02352727,0.012276275,0.021823833,0.031456962,0.010509889,0.02098837,0.010055349,0.021041358,0.033461962,0.038574174,0.021947311,0.024247527,0.019709276,0.026991049,"['abalone', 'red abalone']","[0.010869565217391, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0]"

By a combination of molecular dynamics simulation and theoretical analysis it is shown that the characteristic nanostructure of mineralized collagen fibrils is vital for its high strength and its ability to sustain large deformation, as is relevant to the physiological role of bone, creating a strong and tough material. An analysis of the molecular mechanisms of protein and mineral phases under large deformation of mineralized collagen fibrils reveals a fibrillar toughening mechanism that leads to a manifold increase of energy dissipation compared to fibrils without mineral phase. This fibrillar toughening mechanism increases the resistance to fracture by forming large local yield regions around crack-like defects, a mechanism that protects the integrity of the entire structure by allowing for localized failure. As a consequence, mineralized collagen fibrils are able to tolerate microcracks of the order of several hundred micrometres in size without causing any macroscopic failure of the tissue, which may be essential to enable bone remodelling. The analysis proves that adding nanoscopic small platelets to collagen fibrils increases their Young's modulus and yield strength as well as their fracture strength. We find that mineralized collagen fibrils have a Young's modulus of 6.23 GPa (versus 4.59 GPa for the collagen fibril), yield at a tensile strain of 6.7% (versus 5% for the collagen fibril) and feature a fracture stress of 0.6 GPa (versus 0.3 GPa for the collagen fibril).",0.013447004,0.019423448,0.02675043,0.013391545,0.8893189,0.024686366,0.03362115,0.018734412,0.016517973,0.023272151,0.012497013,0.011582313,0.019522917,0.018576859,0.024387084,0.013198101,0.031397726,0.021170134,0.015406748,0.013977243,0.02050946,0.015879126,0.014947007,0.029577855,0.88223827,0.021034833,0.83124816,0.03438763,0.012306535,['alsomitra macrocarpa'],[0.0],[0]

The release of 3H2O from [3,4-(3)H]proline labeled, under-hydroxylated chicken protocollagen type I depended on the presence of the cofactors 2-oxoglutarate, ascorbate, Fe2+ and O2. The release of 3H2O could be inhibited by the prolyl 4-hydroxylase inhibitors zinc, 2,2'-dipyridyl, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid and pyridine-2,4-dicarboxylate, as well as by the synthetic peptide (Pro-Pro-Gly)10. This synthetic peptide could also serve as substrate, because it enhanced the decarboxylation of 2-oxo[5-(14)C]glutarate. Alvinella prolyl hydroxylase appeared to be related to type II vertebrate enzyme because of its lack of affinity for poly (L-proline) and resistance to inactivation by an irreversible peptide inhibitor of chicken prolyl 4-hydroxylase. Maximal enzyme activity was observed in solutions with less than 10% oxygen saturation. By contrast, chicken enzyme was most active at saturating oxygen concentrations. Further data suggest that the Alvinella enzymes are able to accept the 2-oxo acids pyruvate, oxaloacetate and 2-oxoadipinate as substitutes of the cosubstarate 2-oxoglutarate.

Protein feeding modified both individual and social IC but increases in dietary protein quantity did not enhance IC. However, diet diversity increased IC levels. In particular, polyfloral diets induced higher GOX activity compared with monofloral diets, including protein-richer diets.

Values for pollinator sharing (a measure of the degree of generalization in pollination systems) showed the reverse pattern, in that groups with high pollination efficiency had low values of pollinator sharing. Low pollinator sharing may thus be the basis for efficient pollination.

But there are insects that are capable of gluing their eggs to these surfaces by means of proteinaceous secretions. In this study, we analysed the bonding region between the eggs of Crioceris asparagi and the plant surface of Asparagus officinalis using light and cryo-scanning electron microscopy. The wettability of the plant surface by egg secretion was compared with that by Aqua Millipore water, aqueous sugar solution and chicken egg white. Furthermore, the force required to remove C. asparagi eggs from the plant surface was measured, in order to evaluate the egg's bonding strength. Mean pull-off force was 14.7 mN, which is about 8650 times higher than the egg weight. Egg glue was observed spreading over the wax crystal arrays on the plant cladophyll and wetting them. Similar wetting behaviour on the A. officinalis surface was observed for chicken egg white. Our results support the hypothesis that the mechanism of insect egg adhesion on micro- and nanostructured hydrophobic plant surfaces is related to the proteinaceous nature of adhesive secretions of insect eggs. The secretion wets superhydrophobic surfaces and after solidifying builds up a composite, consisting of the solidified glue and wax crystals, at the interface between the egg and plant cuticle.",0.010340462,0.011684532,0.009352015,0.009817968,0.014480405,0.00938201,0.009669678,0.015076778,0.019265931,0.032200787,0.010197848,0.00862135,0.024965703,0.010406051,0.9115068,0.0188931,0.00808342,0.011458006,0.009741645,0.008064616,0.013044503,0.007636451,0.012251738,0.04347206,0.006790251,0.011138971,0.013655017,0.011994065,0.008383307,"['bird', 'amazona farinosa', 'myiozetetes similis', 'pteroglossus torquatus', 'tityra', 'tityra semifasciata', 'parrot', 'parrots', 'ramphastos swainsonii', 'casearia corymbosa', 'birds', 'plants', 'ramphastos', 'myiozetetes', 'ramphastos sulfuratus', 'amazona autumnalis', 'masked tityra', 'pteroglossus', 'myiozetetes granadensis']","[0.019230769230769003, 0.0, 0.0, 0.009615384615384, 0.009615384615384, 0.009615384615384, 0.009615384615384, 0.009615384615384, 0.009615384615384, 0.009615384615384, 0.019230769230769003, 0.019230769230769003, 0.019230769230769003, 0.009615384615384, 0.009615384615384, 0.0, 0.0, 0.009615384615384, 0.009615384615384]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5]"

Unlike female Sphecoidea which transport arthropods one at a time as prey, bees transport pollen requiring specialized scopal (brush) or corbicular (fringed plate) structures to transport the dustlike material externally. Scopae often exhibit further modifications in density and amount of plumosity in relation to the size and ornamentation of the pollen grains they transport. Bees also differ from sphecid wasps by possessing branched body hairs that are relatively densely packed. These hairs, the electrostatic surface potential, and specialized hair groups for extraction of hidden pollen are important in the acquisition of pollen from flowers. Structures for grooming (brushes, combs, and scrapers) and grooming behavior patterns are modified to permit manipulation and packing of pollen in the specialized transport structures. The addition of nectar, so that pollen is packed moist, is a behavior that permits the carrying of pollen of a great variety of sizes and ornamentations in relatively simplified scopae or in corbiculae. The addition of oils to the diet of some bees has resulted in a modified type of scopal structure that has a wooly area basally and stiff guard hairs extending distally and that can transport a mixture of oil and pollen. Special hairs on the fore and mid basitarsi and teeth of hind tibial spurs are modified as oil scraper and manipulation structures. The use of corbiculae in Apidae to transport nesting materials and the hind tibiae in male orchid bees (Euglossini: Apidae) for transporting aromatic compounds involves behavior patterns similar to those for pollen transport in grooming, manipulating, and packing the materials. Other behavioral and physiological adaptations important in the location and acquisition of pollen by bees include individual constancy, oligolecty, seasonal synchrony, preimaginal conditioning, daily synchrony, buzz pollination, and other responses to specific modes of pollen presentation. Most of the behavioral patterns involve learning. They may be modified by extrinsic factors, and they may modify intrinsic structural and physiological characters.",0.013314783,0.008071374,0.005957349,0.011899403,0.006019252,0.007012363,0.006624298,0.025744192,0.029135255,0.017217528,0.011548266,0.8755895,0.007775671,0.007469798,0.006999091,0.019553933,0.005279708,0.010080379,0.016373863,0.008191218,0.012591309,0.01980823,0.017923085,0.018648054,0.00776881,0.020843709,0.003886856,0.012431364,0.012002679,"['fish', 'gambusia holbrooki']","[0.04, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0]"

While the role of symbiotic ants in protecting plants from stem- and leaf-feeding herbivores has been intensively studied, the relationship between ant defense and measures of plant fitness has seldom been quantified. We studied ant aggression, damage by herbivores and seed predators, and fruit production among Acacia drepanolobium trees occupied by four different acacia-ant species in an East African savanna. Levels of ant aggression in response to experimental disturbance differed strongly among the four species. All four ant species recruited more strongly to new leaf growth on host plants following disturbance, while recruitment to developing fruits was on average an order of magnitude lower. Host plants occupied by more aggressive ant species suffered significantly less vegetative damage from leaf-feeding insects, stem-boring beetles, and vertebrate browsers than host plants occupied by less aggressive ant species. However, there were no differences among fruiting host plants occupied by different ant species in levels of seed predation by bruchid seed predators. Fruit production on host trees was significantly correlated with tree stem diameter but not with the identity of resident ants. Our results demonstrate that defense of host plants may differ substantially among ant species and between vegetative and reproductive structures and that fruit production is not necessarily correlated with high levels of aggression by resident ants.",0.017444184,0.01071002,0.007998063,0.09289264,0.007891555,0.003732815,0.00456676,0.012469198,0.006739689,0.011403293,0.003965207,0.028048817,0.009606353,0.5366287,0.012781045,0.007265862,0.011563407,0.008509827,0.021068068,0.004023338,0.003579549,0.019178666,0.006434386,0.014747933,0.010166658,0.006630307,0.006435169,0.007999611,0.010124628,['bacteria'],[0.11111111111111101],[1.0]

A basic set of ultraviolet-, blue- and green-sensitive receptors, encountered among nymphalid butterflies, forms the basis for trichromatic vision. Screening pigments surrounding the light-receiving rhabdoms can modify the spectral sensitivity of the photoreceptors so that the sensitivity peak is in the violet, yellow, red, or even deep-red, specifically in swallowtails (Papilionidae) and whites (Pieridae), thus enhancing color discriminability.

Perennial plants with relatively small leaves had moderate transpiration rates and leaf temperatures close to air temperature. Desert perennials with relatively large leaves had leaf temperatures well below air temperature along with the greatest accompanying transpiration rates of over 20 micrograms per square centimeter per second, but also had correspondingly low temperatures for maximum photosynthesis. The low leaf temperatures measured for these large-leafed species are an exception to the more common pattern for desert plants whereby a smaller leaf size prevents overheating and leads to reductions in transpiration and increased water-use efficiency.

This view is based predominantly on data from humans and horses, which have been shown to choose the most economical gait (walking, running, galloping) for any given speed. It is not certain whether a minimization of metabolic costs is associated with the selection of other prevalent forms of terrestrial gaits, such as grounded running (a widespread gait in birds). Using biomechanical and metabolic measurements of four ostriches moving on a treadmill over a range of speeds from 0.8 to 6.7 m s−1, we reveal here that the selection of walking or grounded running at intermediate speeds also favours a reduction in the metabolic cost of locomotion. This gait transition is characterized by a shift in locomotor kinetics from an inverted–pendulum gait to a bouncing gait that lacks an aerial phase. By contrast, when the ostrich adopts an aerial–running gait at faster speeds, there are no abrupt transitions in mechanical parameters or in the metabolic cost of locomotion. These data suggest a continuum between grounded and aerial running, indicating that they belong to the same locomotor paradigm.",0.012776799,0.010620598,0.013087121,0.006002446,0.0081029,0.013717402,0.007930848,0.008765305,0.011284291,0.01859438,0.004184739,0.008910091,0.010201204,0.009590855,0.006707436,0.011859082,0.011532509,0.005958283,0.004649958,0.01395653,0.016834754,0.006189232,0.017762884,0.008251185,0.010010187,0.008934906,0.013007708,0.011326573,0.90723395,"['geraniaceae', 'erodium cicutarium']","[0.02, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0]"

Melanized microorganisms are often the dominating species in certain extreme environments, such as soils contaminated with radionuclides, suggesting that the presence of melanin is beneficial in their life cycle. We hypothesized that ionizing radiation could change the electronic properties of melanin and might enhance the growth of melanized microorganisms. Methodology/Principal Findings Ionizing irradiation changed the electron spin resonance (ESR) signal of melanin, consistent with changes in electronic structure. Irradiated melanin manifested a 4-fold increase in its capacity to reduce NADH relative to non-irradiated melanin. HPLC analysis of melanin from fungi grown on different substrates revealed chemical complexity, dependence of melanin composition on the growth substrate and possible influence of melanin composition on its interaction with ionizing radiation. XTT/MTT assays showed increased metabolic activity of melanized C. neoformans cells relative to non-melanized cells, and exposure to ionizing radiation enhanced the electron-transfer properties of melanin in melanized cells. Melanized Wangiella dermatitidis and Cryptococcus neoformans cells exposed to ionizing radiation approximately 500 times higher than background grew significantly faster as indicated by higher CFUs, more dry weight biomass and 3-fold greater incorporation of 14C-acetate than non-irradiated melanized cells or irradiated albino mutants. In addition, radiation enhanced the growth of melanized Cladosporium sphaerospermum cells under limited nutrients conditions.

The binding of CA to HOOC-FMS resulted in a partial conformational change comparing to the enzyme free in solution, but it can be overcome with increased protein loading density.

These termites import fine grained materials to use as a mortar for the construction of epigeal mounds. Their activities create a topographic feature, raised above the level of seasonal flooding, and also change the physical properties and nutrient status of the mound soil.

In fasting pythons, oxyntopeptic cells located within the fundic glands are typically non-active, with a thick apical tubulovesicular system and numerous zymogen granules. They become active immediately after feeding but return to a non-active state 3 days after the ingestion of the prey. The proton pump, expressed throughout the different fasting/feeding states, is either sequestered in the tubulovesicular system in non-active cells or located along the apical digitations extending within the crypt lumen in active cells. The sodium pump is rapidly upregulated in fed animals and is classically located along the baso-lateral membranes of the gastric oxyntopeptic cells. In the intestine, it is only expressed along the lateral membranes of the enterocytes, i.e., above the lateral spaces and not along the basal side of the cells. Thus, solute transport within the intestinal lining is mainly achieved through the apical part of the cells and across the lateral spaces while absorbed fat massively crosses the entire height of the cells and flows into the intercellular spaces. Therefore, in the Burmese python, the gastrointestinal cellular system quickly upregulates after feeding, due to inexpensive cellular changes, passive mechanisms, and the progressive activation and synthesis of key enzymes such as the sodium pump. This cell plasticity also allows anticipation of the next fasting and feeding periods.",0.03586235,0.01380271,0.90328014,0.009157171,0.018039268,0.005606782,0.007746713,0.020710705,0.046265855,0.012046502,0.01067875,0.011800402,0.01343458,0.00714002,0.0118914,0.012462434,0.010961448,0.005294811,0.009880383,0.007178737,0.010389153,0.010375361,0.022595892,0.051777486,0.011918205,0.006850107,0.004371702,0.017721726,0.012989116,"['ramphastos toco', 'toco toucan', 'bird']","[0.0, 0.0, 0.011494252873563001]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0]"

To investigate the strain-sensing (or strain-amplifying) property of the microstructure, an optical characterization setup was devised based on the interference pattern formed by reflected laser beams from different surfaces of the microstructures.

How the ordered structure of aragonite layers is achieved has been unclear. Suzuki et al. (p. 1388, published online 13 August 2009; see the Perspective by Kröger) identified two acidic matrix proteins (Pif 97 and Pif 80) that regulate nacre formation in the Japanese pearl oyster. The proteins appear to form a complex in which Pif 80 binds to aragonite and Pif 97 binds to other macromolecules in the organic matrix. A matrix protein is identified that regulates nacre formation in the Japanese pearl oyster. The mollusk shell is a hard tissue consisting of calcium carbonate crystals and an organic matrix. The nacre of the shell is characterized by a stacked compartment structure with a uniformly oriented c axis of aragonite crystals in each compartment. Using a calcium carbonate–binding assay, we identified an acidic matrix protein, Pif, in the pearl oyster Pinctada fucata that specifically binds to aragonite crystals. The Pif complementary DNA (cDNA) encoded a precursor protein, which was posttranslationally cleaved to produce Pif 97 and Pif 80.

High mineral content generally leads to brittleness, yet natural materials such as bone, mollusk shells or glass sponge achieve relatively high toughness considering the weakness of their constituents through intricate microstructures. In particular, nanometers thick organic interfaces organized in micro-architectures play a key role in providing toughness by various processes including crack deflection, crack bridging or energy dissipation. While these interfaces are critical in these materials, their composition, structure and mechanics is often poorly understood. In this work we focus on nacre, one of the most impressive hard biological materials in terms of toughness. We performed interfacial fracture tests on chevron notched nacre samples from three different species: red abalone, top shell and pearl oyster. We found that the intrinsic toughness of the interfaces is indeed found to be extremely low, in the order of the toughness of the mineral inclusions themselves. Such low toughness is required for the cracks to follow the interfaces, and to deflect and circumvent the mineral tablets. This result highlights the efficacy of toughening mechanisms in natural materials, turning low-toughness inclusions and interfaces into high-performance composites. We found that top shell nacre displayed the highest interfacial toughness, because of higher surface roughness and a more resilient organic material, and also through extrinsic toughening mechanisms including crack deflection, crack bridging and process zone. In the context of biomimetics, the main implication of this finding is that the interface in nacre-like composite does not need to be tough; the extensibility or ductility of the interfaces may be more important than their strength and toughness to produce toughness at the macroscale.",0.011173146,0.009148928,0.020375757,0.010260512,0.82712716,0.012935794,0.028387567,0.023705082,0.011022846,0.01978416,0.012218413,0.008737513,0.01263864,0.012685722,0.011761083,0.011131042,0.02270458,0.01507769,0.012930906,0.008801528,0.017665658,0.007452739,0.012296309,0.023238797,0.82397056,0.016712224,0.06008716,0.015052107,0.00990027,['dosidicus gigas'],[0.026315789473684],[1.0]

Saharan silver ants, Cataglyphis bombycina, forage under extreme temperature conditions in the African desert. We show that the ants’ conspicuous silvery appearance is created by a dense array of triangular hairs with two thermoregulatory effects. They enhance not only the reflectivity of the ant’s body surface in the visible and near-infrared range of the spectrum, where solar radiation culminates, but also the emissivity of the ant in the mid-infrared. The latter effect enables the animals to efficiently dissipate heat back to the surroundings via blackbody radiation under full daylight conditions.

To help solve these problems, we demonstrated two types of artificial muscles that convert the chemical energy of high–energy-density fuels to mechanical energy. The first type stores electrical charge and uses changes in stored charge for mechanical actuation. In contrast with electrically powered electrochemical muscles, only half of the actuator cycle is electrochemical.

How tardigrades survive desiccation has remained a mystery for more than 250 years. Trehalose, a disaccharide essential for several organisms to survive drying, is detected at low levels or not at all in some tardigrade species, indicating that tardigrades possess potentially novel mechanisms for surviving desiccation. Here we show that tardigrade-specific intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs) are essential for desiccation tolerance. TDP genes are constitutively expressed at high levels or induced during desiccation in multiple tardigrade species. TDPs are required for tardigrade desiccation tolerance, and these genes are sufficient to increase desiccation tolerance when expressed in heterologous systems. TDPs form non-crystalline amorphous solids (vitrify) upon desiccation, and this vitrified state mirrors their protective capabilities. Our study identifies TDPs as functional mediators of tardigrade desiccation tolerance, expanding our knowledge of the roles and diversity of disordered proteins involved in stress tolerance.",0.035934202,0.01870889,0.03058656,0.026467439,0.03514015,0.0296164,0.03813099,0.02760142,0.03349814,0.022964582,0.8912491,0.027347155,0.044118717,0.017764341,0.030619334,0.83008975,0.020820878,0.023905342,0.03962053,0.048704997,0.034848075,0.030722085,0.9387454,0.035884704,0.03604091,0.03134751,0.022755269,0.044269014,0.030323634,['sharks'],[0.055555555555555004],[1.0]

This system is of special interest because the tree fruits during an annual period of fruit scarcity in a forest characterized by high proportions of animal-dispersed plants and obligate frugivores. Results show that the Masked Tityra (Tityra semifasciata) is an effective dispersal agent of seeds of this tree because it: (1) regurgitates viable seeds, (2) is a common and regular visitor throughout the season, (3) has high feeding rates, (4) removes seeds from the vicinity of the parent tree before processing them, and (5) depends on this rather than other plants fruiting at the same time. Twenty-one other visitors were deficient dispersers, although some depended heavily on fruit of this tree for food. Two parrots (Amazona autumnalis and Amazona farinosa) preclude dispersal by strip- ping arils with their bills and dropping all seeds in situ. Fourteen species are occasional visitors. Five visitors (Ramphastos sulfuratus, Ramphastos swainsonii, Pteroglossus torquatus, Myiozetetes similis, and Myiozetetes granadensis) process seeds undamaged and are sometimes numerically abun- dant, but are absent part of the season and tend to regurgitate seeds in situ. Because fruiting activity of this tree occurs during annual scarcity, it represents a pivotal species in the community. Three obligate frugivores, including one effective disperser and two fruit thieves, depend almost entirely on it for food for periods of 2-6 wk. I hypothesize that extinction of this plant at this site would lead to disappearance of these birds, and would almost certainly depress recruitment of other species of trees for which they serve as dispersal agents at other times of the year.",0.17040889,0.016281845,0.026186608,0.05116211,0.026017876,0.010935264,0.009363486,0.06835087,0.013909145,0.07273335,0.017130388,0.25100085,0.018904386,0.37560984,0.015487535,0.018125786,0.024528123,0.035955213,0.8974323,0.013912992,0.020919919,0.06794551,0.018605651,0.019116506,0.018956533,0.015196483,0.013386619,0.01499698,0.024311712,[],[],[]

These rules determine how group-living animals move, make decisions, and transmit information between individuals. Nonetheless, few studies have explicitly determined these interaction rules in moving groups, and very little is known about the interaction rules of fish. Here, we identify three key rules for the social interactions of mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki): (i) Attraction forces are important in maintaining group cohesion, while we find only weak evidence that fish align with their neighbor’s orientation; (ii) repulsion is mediated principally by changes in speed; (iii) although the positions and directions of all shoal members are highly correlated, individuals only respond to their single nearest neighbor. The last two of these rules are different from the classical models of collective animal motion, raising new questions about how fish and other animals self-organize on the move.",0.014925919,0.01785857,0.01427923,0.042643115,0.00928789,0.010364541,0.008101957,0.007839497,0.01711827,0.017520405,0.012535933,0.024371637,0.013020018,0.011969661,0.007002356,0.012922864,0.017820165,0.015146283,0.012410898,0.010491883,0.007185449,0.9081019,0.0153632,0.013607888,0.007015235,0.02240343,0.008190989,0.005909486,0.009750003,['mytilus edulis'],[0.023809523809523003],[1.0]

Orchidantha inouei has a zygomorphic flower located just above the ground. Observations revealed that the plant is visited frequently and is pollinated by scarabaeid dung beetles, mainly members of the genus Onthophagus. All four species of Onthophagus collected on O. inouei have also been caught using traps baited with dung or carrion in Borneo. Onthophagus was presumably attracted to the dung-like odor of the flower. Pollination of O. inouei is different from other examples of beetle pollination in that its flower provides neither reward nor protected space. Dung beetles are excellent at following a particular dung scent. Orchidantha is the only genus that includes species lacking floral nectar.

Ants show complex interactions with plants, both facultative and mutualistic, ranging from grazers through seed predators and dispersers to herders of some herbivores and guards against others. But ants are rarely pollinators, and their visits to flowers may be detrimental to plant fitness. 2. Plants therefore have various strategies to control ant distributions, and restrict them to foliage rather than flowers. These 'filters' may involve physical barriers on or around flowers, or 'decoys and bribes' sited on the foliage (usually extrafloral nectaries - EFNs). Alternatively, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are used as signals to control ant behaviour, attracting ants to leaves and/or deterring them from functional flowers. Some of the past evidence that flowers repel ants by VOCs has been equivocal and we describe the shortcomings of some experimental approaches, which involve behavioural tests in artificial conditions. 3. We review our previous study of myrmecophytic acacias, which used in situ experiments to show that volatiles derived from pollen can specifically and transiently deter ants during dehiscence, the effects being stronger in ant-guarded species and more effective on resident ants, both in African and Neotropical species. In these plants, repellence involves at least some volatiles that are known components of ant alarm pheromones, but are not repellent to beneficial bee visitors. 4. We also present new evidence of ant repellence by VOCs in temperate flowers, which is usually pollen-based and active on common European ants. We use these data to indicate that across a wide range of plants there is an apparent trade-off in ant-controlling filter strategies between the use of defensive floral volatiles and the alternatives of decoying EFNs or physical barriers.",0.03002461,0.023717104,0.012747936,0.062274218,0.0181374,0.006480482,0.011688943,0.010811124,0.008423816,0.014430054,0.004702198,0.014015674,0.013936294,0.87265426,0.011913708,0.012712201,0.03334038,0.017491553,0.030714829,0.006411669,0.007548363,0.015072295,0.015773468,0.013234386,0.023211759,0.015048854,0.016193457,0.016338985,0.019630546,"['strongylocentrotus purpuratus', 'purple sea urchin', 'echinoderms', 'sea urchin']","[0.0, 0.0, 0.03125, 0.015625]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5]"

Their mechanical properties therefore inevitably affect functioning of the legs; yet interspecific studies of the scaling of locomotor mechanics have all but neglected the feet and their soft tissues. Here we determine how contact area and stiffness of footpads in digitigrade carnivorans scale with body mass in order to show how footpads’ mechanical properties and size covary to maintain their functional integrity. As body mass increases across several orders of magnitude, we find the following: (i) foot contact area does not keep pace with increasing body mass; therefore pressure increases, placing footpad tissue of larger animals potentially at greater risk of damage; (ii) but stiffness of the pads also increases, so the tissues of larger animals must experience less strain; and (iii) total energy stored in hindpads increases slightly more than that in the forepads, allowing additional elastic energy to be returned for greater propulsive efficiency. Moreover, pad stiffness appears to be tuned across the size range to maintain loading regimes in the limbs that are favourable for long-bone remodelling. Thus, the structural properties of footpads, unlike other biological support-structures, scale interspecifically through changes in both geometry and material properties, rather than geometric proportions alone, and do so with consequences for both maintenance and operation of other components of the locomotor system.",0.009111902,0.014674807,0.014533476,0.006243167,0.92523706,0.015639406,0.035087448,0.015886951,0.017595947,0.022964139,0.007781019,0.005830069,0.012461144,0.01014401,0.030474285,0.011751001,0.012571139,0.012959927,0.011539256,0.008397299,0.017272279,0.013077984,0.010321803,0.013158997,0.065818995,0.01894861,0.84523517,0.023007583,0.016521418,['phragmatopoma californica'],[0.022222222222222],[1.0]

We report the surprising observation that Bacillus subtilis biofilm colonies and pellicles are extremely nonwetting, greatly surpassing the repellency of Teflon toward water and lower surface tension liquids. The biofilm surface remains nonwetting against up to 80% ethanol as well as other organic solvents and commercial biocides across a large and clinically important concentration range. We show that this property limits the penetration of antimicrobial liquids into the biofilm, severely compromising their efficacy. To highlight the mechanisms of this phenomenon, we performed experiments with mutant biofilms lacking ECM components and with functionalized polymeric replicas of biofilm microstructure.

Finally, we report the impenetrability of the biofilm surface by gases, implying defense capability against vapor-phase antimicrobials as well.

These feats are accomplished using awns, helical bristles of dead but hygroscopically active tissue attached to the seeds. Here, we describe the kinematics of explosive dispersal and self-burial based on detailed high-speed and time-lapse videos. We use these observations to develop a simple mechanical model that accounts for the coiling behavior of the awn and allows comparison of the strain energy stored in the awn with the kinetic energy at launch. The model is used to examine tradeoffs between dispersal distance and reliability of the dispersal mechanism.

Besides a slippery peristome which inhibits adhesion of insects they employ epicuticular wax crystals on the inner walls of the conductive zone of the pitchers to hamper insect attachment by adhesive devices. It has been proposed that the detachment of individual crystals and the resulting contamination of adhesive organs is responsible for capturing insects. However, our results provide evidence in favour of a different mechanism, mainly based on the stability and the roughness of the waxy surface. First, we were unable to detect a large quantity of crystal fragments on the pads of insects detached from mature pitcher surfaces of Nepenthes alata. Second, investigation of the pitcher surface by focused ion beam treatment showed that the wax crystals form a compact 3D structure. Third, atomic force microscopy of the platelet-shaped crystals revealed that the crystals are mechanically stable, rendering crystal detachment by insect pads unlikely. Fourth, the surface profile parameters of the wax layer showed striking similarities to those of polishing paper with low grain size. By measuring friction forces of insects on this artificial surface we demonstrate that microscopic roughness alone is sufficient to minimize insect attachment. A theoretical model shows that surface roughness within a certain length scale will prevent adhesion by being too rough for adhesive pads but not rough enough for claws.",0.011205873,0.006040238,0.008100915,0.012902576,0.009560473,0.011340999,0.004127513,0.007402884,0.009844561,0.9116155,0.005583308,0.010336998,0.006277397,0.014869591,0.022734204,0.006651111,0.005835359,0.00815582,0.009518956,0.010374181,0.003780007,0.010219819,0.007691642,0.011245165,0.009344376,0.010223707,0.007998344,0.013456363,0.017539417,[],[],[]

The structure of a Toco toucan (Ramphastos toco) beak was found to be a sandwich composite with an exterior of keratin and a fibrous network of closed cells made of calcium-rich proteins. The keratin layer is comprised of superposed hexagonal scales (50 μm diameter and 1 μm thickness) glued together. Its tensile strength is about 50 MPa and Young’s modulus is 1.4 GPa. Micro and nanoindentation hardness measurements corroborate these values. The keratin shell exhibits a strain-rate sensitivity with a transition from slippage of the scales due to release of the organic glue, at a low strain rate (5 × 10−5/s) to fracture of the scales at a higher strain rate (1.5 × 10−3/s). The closed-cell foam is comprised of fibers having a Young’s modulus twice as high as the keratin shells due to their higher calcium content. The compressive response of the foam was modeled by the Gibson–Ashby constitutive equations for open and closed-cell foam. There is a synergistic effect between foam and shell evidenced by experiments and analysis establishing the separate responses of shell, foam, and foam + shell. The stability analysis developed by Karam and Gibson, assuming an idealized circular cross section, was applied to the beak.

Reis et al. (p. 1231, published online 11 November; see the cover) have discovered that cats curl their tongues so that the top surface touches the water. Then, by lifting their tongues rapidly, a column of liquid grows by inertia until gravity induces its breakage and the cats close their jaws to capture the liquid. Lapping frequency is tuned to maximize the volume ingested, depending on the animal's mass; a relationship that holds as true for tabby cats as it does for lions. Cats use fluid inertia to generate a liquid column that they catch in their mouths before gravity destroys it. Animals have developed a range of drinking strategies depending on physiological and environmental constraints. Vertebrates with incomplete cheeks use their tongue to drink; the most common example is the lapping of cats and dogs. We show that the domestic cat (Felis catus) laps by a subtle mechanism based on water adhesion to the dorsal side of the tongue. A combined experimental and theoretical analysis reveals that Felis catus exploits fluid inertia to defeat gravity and pull liquid into the mouth. This competition between inertia and gravity sets the lapping frequency and yields a prediction for the dependence of frequency on animal mass. Measurements of lapping frequency across the family Felidae support this prediction, which suggests that the lapping mechanism is conserved among felines.",0.053985395,0.00295426,0.004701192,0.004573812,0.009481332,0.007579153,0.0027669,0.0044663,0.006217137,0.011350606,0.004892864,0.002869736,0.007624889,0.00254347,0.004347199,0.003467811,0.005663951,0.004009747,0.007664504,0.003474639,0.014709914,0.002236268,0.007461833,0.006534589,0.003622004,0.002516258,0.004192586,0.02181307,0.004976798,"['bees', 'bee']","[0.024691358024691003, 0.037037037037037]","[0.6666666666666661, 1.0]"

Chromatic defocus is a particularly severe problem in eyes with high light-gathering ability, since depth of field is small due to a pupillary opening that is large in relation to the focal length of the eye. Calculations show that in such eyes only a narrow spectral band of light can be in focus on the retina. For the major part of the visual spectrum, spatial resolution should be limited by the optics of the eye and far lower than the resolving power achievable by the retinal cone photoreceptor mosaic. To solve this problem, fishes with irises unresponsive to light have developed lenses with multiple focal lengths. Well-focused images are created at the wavelengths of maximum absorbance of all spectral cone types. Multifocal lenses also appear to be present in some terrestrial species. In eyes with mobile irises, multifocal lenses are correlated with pupil shapes that allow all zones of the lens, with different refractive powers, to participate in the imaging process, irrespective of the state of pupil constriction.",0.015449419,0.84620243,0.012463643,0.012619791,0.009024547,0.010489269,0.009370919,0.012634487,0.009017292,0.009192769,0.004281326,0.00711546,0.009593555,0.010422125,0.008267308,0.004927,0.007905189,0.013174845,0.008630329,0.009101717,0.007612077,0.013134862,0.024281723,0.007934526,0.009217266,0.012510566,0.010650521,0.008877601,0.012966504,['temnothorax albipennis'],[0.0],[0]

Each feature in the seal whisker is sequentially stripped from the original whisker shape. Four whisker-like geometries are created from such methodology. 3D simulations of flow around the structures are performed and the resulting forces on the structures are non-dimensionalized. The lift and drag coefficients of these structures are compared to the real whisker case. The undulations on minor and major axes are found to be necessary in reducing the lift forces. Existence of only one of the undulations fails to weaken the flow and break the vortex tubes and braids in the wake. The offset angle between leading edge and trailing edge are found to have slight effects on the lift and drag coefficients. The reduction in drag coefficient is found to be dependent on the existence of undulations in minor axis. The force responses of whisker-like geometries with undulations on one of their axes are found to be periodic. When the force response on whisker-like geometries with both undulations are found to be chaotic. Vortex shedding frequency of the structure is observed to decrease considerably when no offset angle is introduced into the geometry.

Eight ostriches were induced to run along a trackway and execute turns. Ground reaction forces and three-dimensional kinematics of the body and leg joints were simultaneously recorded, allowing calculation of joint angles and quasi-static net joint torques. Sidesteps, where the leg on the outside of the turn changes the movement direction, and crossovers using the inside leg, occurred with nearly equal frequency. Ostriches executed maneuvers using a simple control strategy that required minimal changes to leg kinematics or net torque production at individual joints. Although ostriches did use acceleration or braking forces to control body rotation, their morphology allowed for both crossovers and sidesteps to be accomplished with minimal net acceleratory/braking force production. Moreover, body roll and ab/adduction of the leg shifted the foot position away from the turn direction, reducing the acceleratory/braking forces required to prevent under- or over-rotation and aligning the leg with the ground reaction force.",0.011978157,0.010950266,0.013433127,0.005261856,0.007157934,0.013253892,0.008366591,0.009430529,0.011876349,0.01855107,0.004632345,0.009045061,0.009052419,0.009093541,0.006361165,0.014630587,0.012395891,0.005688711,0.005056253,0.014571182,0.014225742,0.00793638,0.02014572,0.009300096,0.008988648,0.009097461,0.014343312,0.009986167,0.91061825,['plants'],[0.052631578947368],[1.0]

Recently, protein phosphorylation has also emerged as an important process in biological adhesives. During the last decade, Herbert Waite and his group have indeed characterized several polyphosphoproteins from the adhesive secretions of two different marine organisms, mussels and tube-building worms. This suggests the possibility that polyphosphoproteins could be important components of several bioadhesives and may, therefore, be widely distributed throughout the animal kingdom. Many amino acids can be targets for phosphorylation but only phosphoserine (pSer) has been detected to date in marine adhesive proteins. We investigated whether monoclonal antibodies directed against pSer could be used to specifically label polyphosphoproteins in marine adhesives. Antibodies were applied on histological sections through the foot of the mussel Mytilus edulis and through the building organ of the tube-worm Sabellaria alveolata. In both cases, anti-pSer binding was detected in the adhesive glands (phenol gland and cement gland, respectively). However, the intensity of the immunolabeling was different between the two species, being weak in the former and strong in the latter. With the use of these antibodies, a new pSer-rich bioadhesive has been detected in Cuvierian tubules, the sticky defense organs of sea cucumbers. Immunoblots and amino acid analyses confirmed the presence of polyphosphoproteins in the adhesive secretion of the Cuvierian tubules from three species of sea cucumber. These findings bring to three the number of animal groups in which adhesive processes involve polyphosphoproteins and raise interesting questions about the convergent evolution of these adhesives.",0.022785822,0.015034133,0.01774465,0.014914677,0.034246974,0.015738543,0.013153932,0.021032909,0.017863004,0.8406895,0.00733964,0.021366416,0.014964176,0.014387907,0.91019005,0.013616672,0.012867127,0.012652029,0.010905023,0.013482874,0.012245324,0.011154612,0.009156938,0.0566337,0.015143978,0.026111318,0.025143426,0.018497242,0.029711496,"['lepidoptera', 'moths', 'scarab beetles', 'insects', 'hymenoptera', 'beetles', 'zootermopsis nevadensis', 'termopsidae', 'zootermopsis', 'coleoptera', 'zootermopsis nevadensis nevadensis', 'diptera']","[0.017543859649122, 0.017543859649122, 0.0, 0.017543859649122, 0.017543859649122, 0.017543859649122, 0.017543859649122, 0.017543859649122, 0.017543859649122, 0.017543859649122, 0.017543859649122, 0.017543859649122]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]"

They rely on wet adhesion, which is aided by the secretion of mucus. In nature, the pads will undoubtedly get contaminated regularly through usage, but appear to maintain their stickiness over time. Here, we show in two experiments that the toe pads of White's tree frogs (Litoria caerulea) quickly recover from contamination through a self-cleaning mechanism. We compared adhesive forces prior to and after contamination of (1) the whole animal on a rotatable platform and (2) individual toe pads in restrained frogs mimicking individual steps using a motorised stage. In both cases, the adhesive forces recovered after a few steps but this took significantly longer in single toe pad experiments from restrained frogs, showing that use of the pads increases recovery. We propose that both shear movements and a ‘flushing’ effect of the secreted mucus play an important role in shedding particles/contaminants.",0.011495051,0.005430015,0.009830835,0.011427159,0.011351034,0.010729022,0.004128863,0.007772155,0.011138029,0.917169,0.006277046,0.011132191,0.007009529,0.013337472,0.027847772,0.006114068,0.00478663,0.008332918,0.010224079,0.009109956,0.003888242,0.007850376,0.007443482,0.012456274,0.008731061,0.011407568,0.008348879,0.017859466,0.01596545,"['hummingbirds', 'bird', 'birds']","[0.016129032258064002, 0.11290322580645101, 0.048387096774193006]","[0.14285714285714202, 1.0, 0.42857142857142805]"

High-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) data reveal that the earliest biologically induced precipitates are crystalline ZnS nanoparticles 1−5 nm in diameter. Although most nanocrystals have the sphalerite structure, nanocrystals of wurtzite are also present, consistent with a predicted size dependence for ZnS phase stability. Nearly all the nanocrystals are concentrated into 1−5 μm diameter spheroidal aggregates that display concentric banding patterns indicative of episodic precipitation and flocculation. Abundant disordered stacking sequences and faceted, porous crystalaggregate morphologies are consistent with aggregation-driven growth of ZnS nanocrystals prior to and/or during spheroid formation. Spheroids are typically coated by organic polymers or associated with microbial cellular surfaces, and are concentrated roughly into layers within the biofilm. Size, shape, structure, degree of crystallinity, and polymer associations will all impact ZnS solubility, aggregation and coarsening behavior, transport in groundwater, and potential for deposition by sedimentation. Results presented here reveal nanometer- to micrometer-scale attributes of biologically induced ZnS formation likely to be relevant to sequestration via bacterial sulfate reduction (BSR) of other potential contaminant metal(loid)s, such as Pb2+, Cd2+, As3+ and Hg2+, into metal sulfides. The results highlight the importance of basic mineralogical information for accurate prediction and monitoring of long-term contaminant metal mobility and bioavailability in natural and constructed bioremediation systems.

The calcite (CaCO(3)) crystals of tooth components, plates, fibers, and a high-Mg polycrystalline matrix, have highly co-oriented crystallographic axes. This ability to co-orient calcite in a mineralized structure is shared by all echinoderms. However, the physico-chemical mechanism by which calcite crystals become co-oriented in echinoderms remains enigmatic. Here, we show differences in calcite c-axis orientations in the tooth of the purple sea urchin ( Strongylocentrotus purpuratus ), using high-resolution X-ray photoelectron emission spectromicroscopy (X-PEEM) and microbeam X-ray diffraction (muXRD). All plates share one crystal orientation, propagated through pillar bridges, while fibers and polycrystalline matrix share another orientation. Furthermore, in the forming end of the tooth, we observe that CaCO(3) is present as amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC). We demonstrate that co-orientation of the nanoparticles in the polycrystalline matrix occurs via solid-state secondary nucleation, propagating out from the previously formed fibers and plates, into the amorphous precursor nanoparticles. Because amorphous precursors were observed in diverse biominerals, solid-state secondary nucleation is likely to be a general mechanism for the co-orientation of biomineral components in organisms from different phyla.",0.007139415,0.012835018,0.018555367,0.012389403,0.022316791,0.006751286,0.005309666,0.8270514,0.015527895,0.015114485,0.014215301,0.03422524,0.028758552,0.00863236,0.008954709,0.010019084,0.006194376,0.015696922,0.016488198,0.0097776,0.009266069,0.006304484,0.011753176,0.021513736,0.010282059,0.009849229,0.005956038,0.012309926,0.012909744,[],[],[]

We examined the distribution, anatomy, innervation and response properties of ISOs on the face and body of crocodilians and documented related behaviors for an alligatorid (Alligator mississippiensis) and a crocodylid (Crocodylus niloticus). Each of the ISOs (roughly 4000 in A. mississippiensis and 9000 in C. niloticus) was innervated by networks of afferents supplying multiple different mechanoreceptors. Electrophysiological recordings from the trigeminal ganglion and peripheral nerves were made to isolate single-unit receptive fields and to test possible osmoreceptive and electroreceptive functions. Multiple small (<0.1 mm2) receptive fields, often from a single ISO, were recorded from the premaxilla, the rostral dentary, the gingivae and the distal digits. These responded to a median threshold of 0.08 mN. The less densely innervated caudal margins of the jaws had larger receptive fields (>100 mm2) and higher thresholds (13.725 mN). Rapidly adapting, slowly adapting type I and slowly adapting type II responses were identified based on neuronal responses. Several rapidly adapting units responded maximally to vibrations at 20–35 Hz, consistent with reports of the ISOs' role in detecting prey-generated water surface ripples. Despite crocodilians' armored bodies, the ISOs imparted a mechanical sensitivity exceeding that of primate fingertips. We conclude that crocodilian ISOs have diverse functions, including detection of water movements, indicating when to bite based on direct contact of pursued prey, and fine tactile discrimination of items held in the jaws.",0.007536405,0.021700071,0.006648831,0.06215976,0.002244372,0.007342732,0.002765879,0.004152939,0.018821726,0.012336316,0.005157932,0.007856353,0.007139902,0.006319453,0.004678908,0.005874933,0.005749939,0.01265673,0.004801358,0.007305765,0.003361068,0.37688673,0.007294566,0.008295716,0.003257266,0.007879621,0.004429877,0.007115639,0.008551847,[],[],[]

They perceive the world through semiochemicals with inordinate sensitivity.A male moth, for example, can detect a “scent of woman,” i.e., a female-produced sex pheromone, even when the signal-to-noise ratio is very low. In a sense the antennae are “signal translators.” The chemicals signals are “translated” into the language of the brain (nerve impulses or spikes) by an array of sensilla mainly located on the antennae. This information is conveyed to the brain for further processing. Chemical ecologists utilize insect antennae as biosensors for the identification of pheromones and other semiochemicals. The insect olfactory system is also highly selective, able to discriminate natural pheromones from molecules with minimal structural changes. In some cases, one stereoisomer functions as an attractant sex pheromone and its antipode is a behavioral antagonist (inhibitory signal). The specificity of the olfactory system seems to be achieved by two layers of filters. The first level of discrimination is determined by odorantbinding proteins (OBPs) that assist the hydrophobic pheromones to cross an aqueous barrier and reach their receptors. Both OBP and odorant receptor (OR) contribute to the specificity of the cell response and lead to the remarkable selectivity of the insect olfactory system. The members of the OBP-gene family, encoding the encapsulins, form a large group with olfactory and non-olfactory proteins. While the functions of many members of the family are yet to be determined, there is solid evidence for the mode of action of OBPs. Pheromones (and other semiochemicals) enter the sensillar lymph through pore tubules in the cuticle (sensillar wall), are solubilized upon being encapsulated by odorant-binding proteins, and transported to the olfactory receptors. Bound pheromone molecules are protected Topics in Current Chemistry (2005) 240: 1– 36 DOI 10.1007/b98314 © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005 from odorant-degrading enzymes. Upon interaction with negatively-charged sites at the dendritic membrane, the OBP-ligand complex undergoes a conformational change that leads to the ejection of pheromone.

This information can enhance the precision of models used to predict if extraterrestrial and other hostile environments are able to support life; furthermore, chaotropes may be used to extend the growth windows for key microbes, such as saprotrophs, in cold ecosystems and manmade biomes.",0.007814613,0.011937183,0.007687652,0.004874939,0.009956083,0.009959525,0.008772563,0.005805099,0.010307304,0.006545727,0.011314666,0.006739491,0.006774325,0.005740882,0.004103032,0.014881423,0.005875735,0.007328237,0.006076336,0.007396647,0.009564851,0.006431286,0.94299084,0.004085135,0.008246738,0.00815692,0.00612145,0.008787208,0.011177257,[],[],[]

Extensive studies on the dermis revealed that it can adopt three different states having different mechanical properties that can be reversibly converted. These are the stiff, standard and soft states. The standard state is readily produced when a dermal piece is immersed in the sea water containing Ca2+, whereas the soft state can be produced by removal of Ca2+. A stiffening protein, tensilin, has been isolated from some sea cucumbers (Cucumaria frondosa and Holothuria leucospilota). Although tensilin converts the state of the dermis from soft to standard, it cannot convert from standard to stiff. In this study, we isolated and partially purified a novel stiffening factor from the dermis of Holothuria leucospilota. The factor stiffened the dermis in normal artificial sea water (ASW) but did not stiffen the soft dermis in Ca2+-free ASW. It also stiffened the dermis that had been converted to the standard state in Ca2+-free ASW by the action of tensilin. These results suggest that the factor produces the stiff dermis from the standard state but cannot work as a stiffener on the soft dermis. Its addition to longitudinal muscles of the sea cucumber produced no effects, suggesting that its effect is specific to the catch connective tissue. Its stiffening activity was susceptible to trypsin, meaning that it is a polypeptide, and its molecular mass estimated from gel filtration chromatography was 2.4 kDa.",0.005489019,0.006642116,0.029621333,0.007467069,0.010531506,0.020638773,0.006078432,0.007494504,0.9157465,0.009251404,0.009300707,0.019616148,0.008248907,0.003637853,0.01386269,0.014137658,0.006015599,0.010298181,0.005556679,0.014256702,0.008301293,0.008482259,0.01897379,0.012791194,0.003792454,0.009061334,0.004967163,0.011803734,0.00636358,['limpets'],[0.15384615384615302],[1.0]

In Strongylocentrotus purpuratus the pressure was found to fluctuate rhythmically about a mean of -8 Pa, and was negative for 70% of the time. This is at variance with the theoretically required positive pressures of the pneu hypothesis. Furthermore, there were no sustained significant differences between the pressure patterns of fed and starved urchins, presumed to be growing and not growing, respectively. The rhythmical fluctuations in pressure were caused by movements of the lantern which changed the curvature and tension of the peristomial membrane. We developed a mathematical and morphological model relating lantern movements, membrane tension, and pressure, that correctly predicts the magnitude of the fluctuations. Pressures predicted by the model depend also on coelomic volume changes. In Lytechinus variegatus simultaneous retraction of the podia, which causes expansion of the ampullae, resulted in an 8.8 Pa increase in coelomic pressure, relative to the pressure during simultaneous podial protraction.",0.009039993,0.01684516,0.012416369,0.006416428,0.87670326,0.02131635,0.029952077,0.016523022,0.016870022,0.029020132,0.009035919,0.006238536,0.014256615,0.009649392,0.037973188,0.011126261,0.016999543,0.013715643,0.013362037,0.009613496,0.016420482,0.01348335,0.011601386,0.013791622,0.05972928,0.019563897,0.907982,0.031960946,0.024260629,"['golden-fronted woodpecker', 'melanerpes aurifrons', 'melanerpes']","[0.0, 0.012987012987012, 0.012987012987012]","[0.0, 1.0, 1.0]"

How to facilitate the spread of useful resources but restrict harmful substances? This dilemma reaches a zenith in famine relief. Survival depends on distributing food fast but that could increase vulnerability to poisons. We tested how Temnothorax albipennis ants solve this dilemma in the distribution of honey solution after 48 h of starvation in four colonies with individually marked workers. We constructed the complete network of liquid food transmission (trophallaxis) between individuals. Within the first 30 min of famine relief, 95% of the workers received food and the distribution rate was an order of magnitude faster compared to the controls. We tested the assumptions of a simple analytical model that best fitted our data. Good mixing during famine relief was facilitated by the movement of internal workers away from the brood pile and the movement of foragers with food away from the nest entrance. This is intriguing because T. albipennis workers have spatial fidelity zones and in the controls internal and external workers were segregated. We discovered that colony vulnerability to poisons during famine relief might be mitigated by: (1) the dilution of food from the same source through mixing, (2) the concentration of food in workers positioned midway between the colony centre and its periphery and (3) the existence of living 'silos'. The latter are expendable foragers, who stay inside the nest and store food during famine relief, thus acting as potential disposable testers for food toxicity. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",0.8846552,0.012222303,0.032844514,0.021130292,0.017207164,0.01591347,0.008275092,0.015878225,0.011822766,0.031039959,0.03593423,0.0505531,0.02647182,0.06778556,0.012694934,0.023389053,0.012889155,0.02855432,0.8344566,0.021145115,0.025644278,0.016072547,0.029042175,0.012018404,0.015673297,0.022738766,0.010932392,0.029629545,0.021720208,['insects'],[0.058823529411764004],[1.0]

Gerbode et al. (p. 1087) analyzed the biomechanics of cucumber tendril coiling. The process depends on a thin layer of cells within the tendril that becomes lignified during the coiling process. A construct of pre-strained silicon sheets, fabric ribbon, and copper wire reproduced the coiling functions in abiotic materials. Physical and mathematical models explained the peculiar response by which the cucumber tendril initially overwinds when pulled further. Plants climb via lifelines that are a mix of strength and flexibility. The helical coiling of plant tendrils has fascinated scientists for centuries, yet the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Moreover, despite Darwin’s widely accepted interpretation of coiled tendrils as soft springs, their mechanical behavior remains unknown. Our experiments on cucumber tendrils demonstrate that tendril coiling occurs via asymmetric contraction of an internal fiber ribbon of specialized cells. Under tension, both extracted fiber ribbons and old tendrils exhibit twistless overwinding rather than unwinding, with an initially soft response followed by strong strain-stiffening at large extensions. We explain this behavior using physical models of prestrained rubber strips, geometric arguments, and mathematical models of elastic filaments. Collectively, our study illuminates the origin of tendril coiling, quantifies Darwin’s original proposal, and suggests designs for biomimetic twistless springs with tunable mechanical responses.",0.009572311,0.005418109,0.029438958,0.007990742,0.010038665,0.01590004,0.009542953,0.03171545,0.016850885,0.014271915,0.019217597,0.021027446,0.011032576,0.012162898,0.032209836,0.015905138,0.008177689,0.01177585,0.006611618,0.01462227,0.009706208,0.010099669,0.008429985,0.9043959,0.02065284,0.012466121,0.005901209,0.01018475,0.009954087,[],[],[]

Indeed, although the basic condition for mammals is dichromacy, diverse nocturnal mammals have only monochromatic vision, resulting from functional loss of the short-wavelength sensitive opsin gene. However, many nocturnal primates maintain intact two opsin genes and thus have dichromatic capacity. The evolutionary significance of this surprising observation has not yet been elucidated. We used a molecular population genetics approach to test evolutionary hypotheses for the two intact opsin genes of the fully nocturnal aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis), a highly unusual and endangered Madagascar primate. No evidence of gene degradation in either opsin gene was observed for any of 8 aye-aye individuals examined. Furthermore, levels of nucleotide diversity for opsin gene functional sites were lower than those for 15 neutrally evolving intergenic regions (>25 kb in total), which is consistent with a history of purifying selection on aye-aye opsin genes. The most likely explanation for these findings is that dichromacy is advantageous for aye-ayes despite their nocturnal activity pattern. We speculate that dichromatic nocturnal primates may be able to perceive color while foraging under moonlight conditions, and suggest that behavioral and ecological comparisons among dichromatic and monochromatic nocturnal primates will help to elucidate the specific activities for which color vision perception is advantageous.",0.016027996,0.856387,0.011708835,0.015091228,0.009930909,0.011115339,0.009102684,0.012707982,0.008313635,0.008964173,0.005312747,0.007375549,0.009916549,0.009416578,0.007693925,0.004702124,0.006106747,0.013369199,0.007731652,0.009483979,0.008152523,0.01493425,0.023628356,0.007771096,0.011002005,0.01325905,0.012756052,0.009310418,0.013312565,"['barnacles', 'semibalanus balanoides']","[0.020833333333333003, 0.020833333333333003]","[1.0, 1.0]"

The cushions in the feet of African elephants were examined by means of standard anatomical and histological techniques, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

None of the rays touches the ground directly. The cushions consist of sheets or strands of fibrous connective tissue forming larger metacarpal/metatarsal and digital compartments and smaller chambers which were filled with adipose tissue. The compartments are situated between tarsal, metatarsal, metacarpal bones, proximal phalanges or other structures of the locomotor apparatus covering the bones palmarly/plantarly and the thick sole skin. Within the cushions, collagen, reticulin and elastic fibres are found. In the main parts, vascular supply is good and numerous nerves course within the entire cushion.

For over a century, biochemists have known that parrots use an unusual set of pigments to produce their rainbow of plumage colours, but their biochemical identity has remained elusive until recently. Here, we use high-performance liquid chromatography to survey the pigments present in the red feathers of 44 species of parrots representing each of the three psittaciform families. We found that all species used the same suite of five polyenal lipochromes (or psittacofulvins) to colour their plumage red, indicating that this unique system of pigmentation is remarkably conserved evolutionarily in parrots. Species with redder feathers had higher concentrations of psittacofulvins in their plumage, but neither feather colouration nor historical relatedness predicted the ratios in which the different pigments appeared. These polyenes were absent from blood at the time when birds were replacing their colourful feathers, suggesting that parrots do not acquire red plumage pigments from the diet, but instead manufacture them endogenously at growing feathers.",0.015909623,0.014281645,0.008596675,0.008029814,0.015734443,0.009928917,0.00511101,0.011953662,0.014700573,0.021911731,0.008884647,0.009829197,0.015821954,0.010151784,0.012506637,0.008071546,0.00915,0.880771,0.011493226,0.017190134,0.01724795,0.012171414,0.014582743,0.014212669,0.010573117,0.012157177,0.010104228,0.012321706,0.009386323,[],[],[]

Its biomechanical and material properties have not previously been explored. Thus I tested sections of baleen from bowhead whales, Balaena mysticetus, and humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, alone or in groups representing miniature ‘racks’, in a flow tank through which water and buoyant particles circulated with variable flow velocity. Kinematic sequences were recorded through an endoscopic camera or viewing window. One set of experiments investigated particle capture; another series analyzed biomechanical behavior, including fringe spacing, movement and interaction. Baleen fringe porosity directly correlates, in a mostly linear fashion, with velocity of incident water flow. However, undulation and interaction of fringes (especially of bowheads) at higher flow velocities can decrease porosity. Fringe porosity depends on distance from the baleen plate. Porosity also varies, with fringe length, by position along the length of an individual plate. Plate orientation, which varied from 0 to 90 deg relative to water flow, is crucial in fringe spacing and particle capture. At all flow velocities, porosity is lowest with plates aligned parallel to water flow. Turbulence introduced when plates rotate perpendicular to flow (as in cross-flow filtration) increases fringe interaction, so that particles more easily strike fringes yet more readily dislodge. Baleen of bowhead whales, which feed by continuous ram filtration, differs biomechanically from that of humpbacks, which use intermittent lunge filtration. The longer, finer fringes of bowhead baleen readily form a mesh-like mat, especially at higher flow velocities, to trap tiny particles.",0.015763862,0.00648195,0.015427036,0.004193286,0.010573242,0.6295554,0.004355412,0.00582164,0.14046848,0.01855203,0.008975592,0.005084862,0.006715507,0.003308587,0.006335336,0.005329854,0.007308512,0.005860594,0.003672347,0.11629797,0.006550827,0.004760497,0.016248334,0.01191765,0.004327451,0.009137144,0.008012793,0.00865287,0.021711858,[],[],[]

Here, we report for the first time the isolation and cloning of odorant-binding proteins from a primitive termite species, the dampwood termite, Zootermopsis nevadensis nevadensis (Isoptera: Termopsidae). A major antennae-specific protein was detected by native PAGE along with four other minor proteins, which were also absent in the extract from control tissues (hindlegs). Multiple cDNA cloning led to the full characterization of the major antennae-specific protein (ZnevOBP1) and to the identification of two other antennae-specific cDNAs, encoding putative odorant-binding proteins (ZnevOBP2 and ZnevOBP3). N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the minor antennal bands and cDNA cloning showed that olfaction in Z. n. nevadensis may involve multiple odorant-binding proteins.

Existing biophysical models predict optimal hummingbird foraging on the basis of equations that assume that fluid rises through the tongue in the same way as through capillary tubes. We demonstrate that the hummingbird tongue does not function like a pair of tiny, static tubes drawing up floral nectar via capillary action. Instead, we show that the tongue tip is a dynamic liquid-trapping device that changes configuration and shape dramatically as it moves in and out of fluids. We also show that the tongue–fluid interactions are identical in both living and dead birds, demonstrating that this mechanism is a function of the tongue structure itself, and therefore highly efficient because no energy expenditure by the bird is required to drive the opening and closing of the trap. Our results rule out previous conclusions from capillarity-based models of nectar feeding and highlight the necessity of developing a new biophysical model for nectar intake in hummingbirds. Our findings have ramifications for the study of feeding mechanics in other nectarivorous birds, and for the understanding of the evolution of nectarivory in general. We propose a conceptual mechanical explanation for this unique fluid-trapping capacity, with far-reaching practical applications (e.g., biomimetics).",0.024156317,0.009911204,0.010652918,0.023524942,0.029290762,0.038287703,0.016604783,0.004569342,0.01917743,0.011453292,0.009933684,0.007957616,0.018761937,0.013969412,0.013940765,0.003049939,0.4542913,0.015107226,0.015973799,0.011494689,0.4285728,0.01890687,0.021333009,0.007447841,0.013530844,0.008374124,0.007989321,0.014816023,0.015381763,[],[],[]

This natural composite has a very high mineral content, which makes it hard and stiff. However it is the toughness of nacre which is the most impressive: it is three orders of magnitude tougher than the mineral it is made of. No manmade composite material can boast such amplification in toughness, and for this reason nacre has become a biomimetic model material. The mineral in nacre comes in the form of microscopic polygonal tablets, which have the ability to 'slide' on one another in large numbers when the material is loaded in tension. This key mechanism makes nacre a quasi-ductile material, which in turn greatly increases its toughness and makes it damage tolerant. Numerous 'artificial nacres' were developed in the past but none of them can truly duplicate the remarkable mechanism of tablet sliding. In this work selected structural features of nacre were implemented in a PMMA-based composite, which for the first time could replicate the collective tablet sliding mechanism. This material demonstrates that the powerful toughening mechanism operating in natural nacre can be duplicated and harnessed in engineering materials.",0.011601308,0.009439326,0.02006415,0.010836267,0.8461881,0.013605737,0.032718573,0.025738334,0.011477034,0.020412492,0.015394984,0.009317387,0.014331876,0.012863572,0.01229825,0.012322566,0.023418723,0.016596952,0.013661319,0.010129437,0.019545127,0.008042582,0.013902967,0.024080416,0.8419083,0.019015634,0.067811646,0.016873825,0.009289066,"['whale', 'whales', 'vertebrates', 'lobsters', 'humans']","[0.016393442622950002, 0.016393442622950002, 0.032786885245901, 0.016393442622950002, 0.016393442622950002]","[0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5]"

Their ecological success is reflected by a high biodiversity and the conquest of nearly every terrestrial habitat. Spiders are closely associated with silk, a material, often seen to be responsible for their great ecological success and gaining high attention in life sciences. However, it is often overlooked that more than half of all Recent spider species have abandoned web building or never developed such an adaptation. These species must have found other, more economic solutions for prey capture and retention, compensating the higher energy costs of increased locomotion activity. Here we show that hairy adhesive pads (scopulae) are closely associated with the convergent evolution of a vagrant life style, resulting in highly diversified lineages of at least, equal importance as the derived web building taxa. Previous studies often highlighted the idea that scopulae have the primary function of assisting locomotion, neglecting the fact that only the distal most pads (claw tufts) are suitable for those purposes. The former observations, that scopulae are used in prey capture, are largely overlooked. Our results suggest the scopulae evolved as a substitute for silk in controlling prey and that the claw tufts are, in most cases, a secondary development. Evolutionary trends towards specialized claw tufts and their composition from a low number of enlarged setae to a dense array of slender ones, as well as the secondary loss of those pads are discussed further.

With few exceptions, the function of cilia and flagella is to beat rhythmically and set up relative motion between themselves and the liquid that surrounds them. The molecular basis of axonemal movement is understood in considerable detail, with the exception of the mechanism that provides its rhythmical or oscillatory quality. Some kind of repetitive ‘switching’ event is assumed to occur; there are several proposals regarding the nature of the ‘switch’ and how it might operate. Herein I first summarise all the factors known to influence the rate of the oscillation (the beating frequency). Many of these factors exert their effect through modulating the mean sliding velocity between the nine doublet microtubules of the axoneme, this velocity being the determinant of bend growth rate and bend propagation rate. Then I explain six proposed mechanisms for flagellar oscillation and review the evidence on which they are based. Finally, I attempt to derive an economical synthesis, drawing for preference on experimental research that has been minimally disruptive of the intricate structure of the axoneme. The ‘provisional synthesis' is that flagellar oscillation emerges from an effect of passive sliding direction on the dynein arms. Sliding in one direction facilitates force‐generating cycles and dynein‐to‐dynein synchronisation along a doublet; sliding in the other direction is inhibitory. The direction of the initial passive sliding normally oscillates because it is controlled hydrodynamically through the alternating direction of the propulsive thrust. However, in the absence of such regulation, there can be a perpetual, mechanical self‐triggering through a reversal of sliding direction due to the recoil of elastic structures that deform as a response to the prior active sliding. This provisional synthesis may be a useful basis for further examination of the problem.",0.014674538,0.015589149,0.009901864,0.009301252,0.014052609,0.8909925,0.005340545,0.010413143,0.03423366,0.03321477,0.01607723,0.00806832,0.011515094,0.007894378,0.009555965,0.003837147,0.013647795,0.007467779,0.006264453,0.0521572,0.014582023,0.00646033,0.026559956,0.020171234,0.009294426,0.012844477,0.011571575,0.007936657,0.01965429,"['sedges', 'carex', 'carex acutiformis']","[0.027777777777777003, 0.027777777777777003, 0.027777777777777003]","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0]"

Six species have been reported to squirt blood, and seven species remain unreported. Five of the latter species were tested in dog trials; one exhibited blood-squirting (Phrynosoma hernandesi), one exhibited precursor behaviors but failed to squirt blood (Phrynosoma ditmarsi), and three yielded negative results (Phrynosoma mcallii, Phrynosoma modestum, and Phrynosoma platyrhinos). Instances of blood-squirting in response to human encounters were collected and largely support the negative results for the three species P. mcallii, P. modestum, and P. platyrhinos. A phylogeny of blood-squirting and nonblood-squirting species is presented with blood-squirting being plesiomorphic in the genus and the synapomorphic condition of nonsquirting species being restricted to a single clade of P. mcallii-modestum-platyrhinos. The possibility of P. douglasii independently evolving an autapomorphic condition remains unresolved. Dog trials with 40 adult Phrynosoma cornutum were conducted to determine influences of body size and sex on squirt frequency and blood mass expelled, as well as to examine aspects of the potential physiological cost of the defense. In 153 trials, 85% of all lizards squirted in at least one trial, 82% squirted in more than one trial, and two lizards squirted daily over the seven-day trial period. Initial body mass positively correlated with the total number of squirts/individual (r2 = 0.28; P < 0.001) and the number of days a lizard continued squirting (r2 = 0.63; P < 0.01). Number of squirts/individual/day declined over the seven-day trial period (r2 = 0.20; P < 0.05). Cumulative mass loss for individual lizards attributable to blood-squirting averaged 0.7 ± 0.8 g (2.0 ± 2.0% body mass), with a high of 2.8 g (6.8% body mass).

The relevant combination of density and kinematic viscosity of air is much lower than for water. Injection of air into boundary layers ('air lubrication') has been used by engineers to speed movement of vehicles (ships, torpedoes) through sea water. Analysis of published and unpublished underwater film leads us to present a hypothesis that free-ranging emperor penguins employ air lubrication in achieving high, probably maximal, underwater speeds (mean ± SD: 5.3 ± 1.01 m s -1 ), prior to jumps. Here we show evidence that penguins dive to 15 to 20 m with air in their plumage and that this compressed air is released as the birds subsequently ascend whilst maintaining depressed feathers. Fine bubbles emerge continu- ously from the entire plumage, forming a smooth layer over the body and generating bubbly wakes behind the penguins. In several hours of film of hundreds of penguins, none were seen to swim rapidly upwards without bubbly wakes. Penguins descend and swim horizontally at about 2 m s -1 ; from simple physical models and calculations presented, we hypothesize that a significant proportion of the enhanced ascent speed is due to air lubrication reducing frictional and form drag, that buoyancy forces alone cannot explain the observed speeds, and that cavitation plays no part in bubble formation.",0.015061852,0.013461016,0.009612498,0.008434245,0.016948486,0.87931406,0.005009037,0.010345641,0.037744716,0.016508175,0.012483267,0.007737797,0.008580694,0.006986668,0.006056658,0.004602519,0.013593731,0.006634441,0.005440578,0.035755254,0.009801155,0.006785203,0.037811223,0.016377265,0.0084185,0.011720605,0.012885977,0.006087976,0.02130445,"['staphylococcus aureus', 'sharks']","[0.014492753623188002, 0.014492753623188002]","[1.0, 1.0]"

It produces between one and four large round leaves that are tightly attached to the ground and form large rosettes of up to 1 m2. These leaves differ markedly from the typical small leaves of most desert plants. Moreover, they have a unique 3D morphology resembling a scaled-down mountainous area with well-developed steep drainage systems, raising the question which selective agents were involved in their evolution. We propose that the large leaves collect rainwater that then infiltrates the soil surrounding the root. We measured the seasonal course of leaf growth, examined the area of wet soil surrounding the root after actual and simulated rain, and modeled the water harvesting capacity using the plant leaf area and the weekly precipitation. We show that even in the slightest rains, water flows above the veins to the leaf’s base where it irrigates the vertical root. A typical plant harvests more than 4,100 cm3 of water per year, and enjoys a water regime of about 427 mm/year, equivalent to the water supply in a Mediterranean climate.

Recognition of morphological similarities between lamnid sharks (the most well known being the great white and the mako) and tunas has led to a general expectation that they also have converged in their functional design; however, no quantitative data exist on the mechanical performance of the locomotor system in lamnid sharks. Here we examine the swimming kinematics, in vivo muscle dynamics and functional morphology of the force-transmission system in a lamnid shark, and show that the evolutionary convergence in body shape and mechanical design between the distantly related lamnids and tunas is much more than skin deep; it extends to the depths of the myotendinous architecture and the mechanical basis for propulsive movements.

In this analysis, the head structures (beak, hyoid, spongy bone, and skull bone with cerebrospinal fluid) of the golden-fronted woodpecker, Melanerpes aurifrons, are explored with x-ray computed tomography images, and their shock-absorbing mechanism is analyzed with a mechanical vibration model and an empirical method. Based on these analyses, a new shock-absorbing system is designed to protect commercial micromachined devices from unwanted high-g and high-frequency mechanical excitations. The new shock-absorbing system consists of close-packed microglasses within two metal enclosures and a viscoelastic layer fastened by steel bolts, which are biologically inspired from a spongy bone contained within a skull bone encompassed with the hyoid of a woodpecker.

Formation of the intricate silica structures of diatoms is regarded as a paradigm for biomolecule-controlled self-assembly of three-dimensional, nano- to microscale-patterned inorganic materials. Silica formation involves long-chain polyamines and phosphoproteins (silaffins and silacidins), which are readily soluble in water, and spontaneously form dynamic supramolecular assemblies that accelerate silica deposition and influence silica morphogenesis in vitro. However, synthesis of diatom-like silica structure in vitro has not yet been accomplished, indicating that additional components are required. Here we describe the discovery and intracellular location of six novel proteins (cingulins) that are integral components of a silica-forming organic matrix (microrings) in the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana. The cingulin-containing microrings are specifically associated with girdle bands, which constitute a substantial part of diatom biosilica. Remarkably, the microrings exhibit protein-based nanopatterns that closely resemble characteristic features of the girdle band silica nanopatterns. Upon the addition of silicic acid the microrings become rapidly mineralized in vitro generating nanopatterned silica replicas of the microring structures. A silica-forming organic matrix with characteristic nanopatterns was also discovered in the diatom Coscinodiscus wailesii, which suggests that preassembled protein-based templates might be general components of the cellular machinery for silica morphogenesis in diatoms.

The cranefly is a weak flier, with many species typically found in wet/moist environments where they lay eggs. Water droplets placed on this insect's wings will spontaneously roll off the surface. In addition, the insect can stand on water bodies without its legs penetrating the water surface.

The scheme is implemented by embedding muscle fibers in finite elements. In any given element, the fiber orientation can be assigned arbitrarily and multiple muscle directions can be simulated. The mechanical stress in each muscle fiber is the sum of active and passive parts.

These organisms (called syntrophs) are biologically significant in terms of their growth at the thermodynamic limit and are considered to be the ideal model to address bioenergetic concepts. We conducted genomic and proteomic analyses of the thermophilic propionate-oxidizing syntroph Pelotomaculum thermopropionicum to obtain the genetic basis for its central catabolic pathway. Draft sequencing and subsequent targeted gap closing identified all genes necessary for reconstructing its propionate-oxidizing pathway (i.e., methylmalonyl coenzyme A pathway). Characteristics of this pathway include the following. (i) The initial two steps are linked to later steps via transferases. (ii) Each of the last three steps can be catalyzed by two different types of enzymes. It was also revealed that many genes for the propionate-oxidizing pathway, except for those for propionate coenzyme A transferase and succinate dehydrogenase, were present in an operon-like cluster and accompanied by multiple promoter sequences and a putative gene for a transcriptional regulator. Proteomic analysis showed that enzymes in this pathway were up-regulated when grown on propionate; of these enzymes, regulation of fumarase was the most stringent. We discuss this tendency of expression regulation based on the genetic organization of the open reading frame cluster. Results suggest that fumarase is the central metabolic switch controlling the metabolic flow and energy conservation in this syntroph.",0.009722658,0.008957258,0.01435973,0.012625306,0.008609287,0.007703295,0.007936548,0.016191429,0.011903323,0.010524566,0.021737942,0.00770613,0.9039463,0.008629354,0.011650743,0.006295922,0.010988564,0.010187207,0.008485917,0.013750711,0.010492626,0.009804742,0.010888026,0.009119663,0.013354382,0.018255752,0.009078407,0.010068201,0.011758734,[],[],[]

These footprints are considered to mediate temporary adhesion of cyprids to substrata and, as such, represent a crucial first step in the colonization of man-made surfaces by barnacles, a process known as biofouling. Interest in this system also stems from the potential for a synthetic reversible adhesion system, based on the strategy used by cyprids. Cyprid footprints were probed using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and nanomechanical data relating to interfacial adhesion forces were correlated with AFM tip chemistry. Commercial Si3N4-tips and chemically functionalized CH3-tips were chosen to mimic the interactions of cyprid footprints with hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces, respectively. Force-extension curves of protein bundles picked up by AFM tips exhibited a characteristic saw-tooth appearance for both types of tip, but demonstrated clear differences relating to pull-off force and pull-off length, based on tip chemistry. Additional (∼6 nN) interfacial adhesion forces between −CH3 functionalized tips and footprints were assigned to hydrophobic interactions. Footprint proteins adhered with greater tenacity to the hydrophobic tip. This may suggest conformational change and denaturing of the protein which would facilitate hydrophobic interaction by enhancing contact forces between −CH3 functionalized tips and hydrophobic groups in the footprint molecule(s). Neither tip removed proteins from the −NH2 substratum suggesting that specific chemical interactions, rather than simple wetting phenomena, govern the adhesion of footprint proteins to that surface.",0.012410483,0.006256212,0.008981243,0.012847845,0.009868938,0.015630776,0.003901757,0.008080403,0.010557147,0.91897994,0.005960704,0.011583345,0.006506212,0.01258547,0.023707284,0.00534443,0.004625196,0.008132286,0.010069813,0.011072646,0.004173658,0.009652588,0.00753892,0.012183523,0.009075839,0.009966787,0.008550424,0.015443116,0.01883751,"['pacific walrus', 'odobenus rosmarus', 'walruses', 'walrus', 'odobenus']","[0.07142857142857101, 0.07142857142857101, 0.07142857142857101, 0.07142857142857101, 0.07142857142857101]","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]"

Although gas exchange is known to increase with the opening of these spiracles, it is not clear how this event relates to gas flow through the tracheal system. We examined the relationship between respiratory airflow and spiracle activity in a ventilating insect, the hissing cockroach, Gromphadorhina portentosa, to better understand the complexity of insect respiratory function. Using simultaneous video recordings of multiple spiracular valves, we found that abdominal spiracles open and close in unison during periods of ventilation. Additionally, independent recordings of CO2 release from the abdominal and thoracic regions and observations of hyperoxic tracer gas movement indicate that air is drawn into the thoracic spiracles and expelled from the abdominal spiracles. Our video recordings suggest that this unidirectional flow is driven by abdominal contractions that occur when the abdominal spiracles open. The spiracles then close as the abdomen relaxes and fills with air from the thorax. Therefore, the respiratory system of the hissing cockroach functions as a unidirectional pump through the coordinated action of the spiracles and abdominal musculature. This mechanism may be employed by a broad diversity of large insects that respire by active ventilation.",0.16592501,0.002898783,0.003896392,0.003180666,0.005469905,0.004821563,0.002729091,0.004016536,0.003037391,0.005482358,0.005422151,0.002103915,0.007731228,0.003152274,0.003220624,0.009807048,0.003711898,0.008179696,0.013394462,0.006358447,0.00437621,0.002509229,0.0102965,0.003887958,0.002645324,0.00379487,0.00264976,0.007256269,0.004960628,['sea otter'],[0.020408163265306003],[1.0]

This review examines experimental data and biophysical theory to analyze why mechanical force prolongs the lifetime of these bonds rather than shortens the lifetime by pulling the ligand out of the binding pocket. Although many mathematical models can explain catch bonds, experiments using structural variants have been more helpful in determining how catch bonds work. The underlying mechanism has been worked out so far only for the bacterial adhesive protein FimH. This protein forms catch bonds because it is allosterically activated when mechanical force pulls an inhibitory domain away from the ligand-binding domain.

We found that an elastically powered movement, ballistic tongue projection in chameleons, maintains high performance over a 20 °C range. Peak velocity and power decline by only 10%–19% with a 10 °C drop, compared to >42% for nonelastic, muscle-powered tongue retraction.

 Fig tree–fig wasp mutualisms are diverse and underpin much biodiversity. The wasps (Agaonidae) are the sole pollinators of the trees (Ficus). Figs are enclosed inflorescences, each of which contains many small flowers. Female wasps (foundresses) enter receptive figs to spread pollen and to lay their eggs individually into fig flowers. As they oviposit, wasps also inject chemicals that transform individual flower ovaries into galls that will feed and house wasp offspring. For fig tree–fig wasp mutualisms to persist, the trees must set seed; therefore, the wasps have both to pollinate and to fail to gall all flower ovaries. However, wasps that avoid pollination costs and/or gall all flowers are predicted to outcompete more cooperative conspecifics, resulting in destabilisation of the mutualism. Here, I review the literature on why wasps pollinate by focusing on how trees reduce investment to unpollinated figs, resulting in ‘sanctions’ to wasps that fail to pollinate via reduced production of offspring. I also review the mechanisms that prevent wasps from galling all flowers, mainly those in monoecious Ficus, that also result in wasps predominantly galling longer flowers whilst leaving shorter flowers to become seeds. I make suggestions for future work and conclude by reaffirming why multiple processes promote stability in fig tree–fig wasp mutualisms.",0.05012739,0.01428188,0.005146948,0.0768439,0.004518098,0.005429278,0.003759471,0.010980908,0.006128648,0.03686845,0.005812711,0.06576356,0.006321993,0.33794874,0.013112148,0.008896971,0.007479476,0.018544845,0.15879546,0.007747299,0.003404856,0.05243427,0.006323005,0.022011576,0.009011363,0.013225143,0.010155547,0.0314673,0.006778025,"['bees', 'apis mellifera', 'honeybee']","[0.037735849056603, 0.0, 0.018867924528301]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.5]"

One approach is to use natural disturbance in unmanaged forests as a template for setting the scale, frequency and pattern of forest operations in managed forests. This review considers the relevance of this approach for conifer plantations in upland Britain. The dynamics of British planted forests are compared with the disturbance dynamics of analogous natural forests with particular reference to disturbance by strong winds. Western hemlock‐Sitka spruce (Tsuga heterophylla‐Picea sitchensis) forests in the Pacific North-west of North America and particularly South-east Alaska provide the most promising comparison. There are few reports on disturbance in these forests, but the regime includes both gap-phase and stand replacement dynamics due to wind. However, the landscape proportion and pattern of resulting structural types are not well defined. The dynamics of planted forests in Britain are dominated by rotational patch clearfelling which results in regular stand replacement and little possibility of the stands developing beyond the stage of stem exclusion towards old-growth. The pattern and timing of felling is driven by economic and visual amenity considerations rather than by an attempt to mimic natural disturbance patterns. Moreover, the structural complexity and remnant elements (such as deadwood, large trees, vegetation patches) left after large scale disturbance are rarely found after conventional timber harvesting. The authors conclude that natural wind disturbance regimes have potential as a reference point for management in British upland forests but at present are not relevant as a model to mimic explicitly. This is because the biodiversity benefits of adopting a ‘natural’ approach in planted forests are unclear compared with management guided by other criteria such as rarity. Furthermore, the spatial and temporal pattern to be mimicked is not sufficiently well understood. Improved knowledge could inform decisions on the scale and distribution of harvesting across a landscape, and modify silvicultural operations to create and maintain the structures and patterns associated with natural disturbance. However, further research is needed to quantify the spatial and temporal characteristics of wind disturbance in upland forests in Britain and in natural forests elsewhere.",0.06110319,0.006540179,0.1701224,0.0063515,0.044776846,0.002726193,0.00984311,0.021382608,0.01766456,0.004756595,0.004666017,0.009256077,0.01029549,0.05088962,0.004948214,0.008542844,0.010298915,0.008213884,0.055110898,0.003124665,0.003770712,0.016361011,0.008357098,0.007635078,0.00845879,0.005966024,0.004097695,0.002482121,0.007510887,['insects'],[0.060975609756097005],[1.0]

The stem was rigid in bending, being stiffened peripherally by lignified material around the vascular bundles, but because of its triangular shape it was vulnerable to local buckling. Despite being and narrow the stem was able to support the seed head, though it sagged appreciably towards the tip. In contrast the stem had very low torsional rigidity, both because of its triangular shape because the strands of lignified material were isolated from each other. In its lowland habitat this allows the drooping stem to twist away from the light winds, so reducing drag and the chances of self-fertilization. This method of reconfiguring is not possible in the shorter, stiffer mountain sedges which must withstand higher winds; many therefore have more circular stems which will be more efficient at resisting bending.",0.003362898,0.005643318,0.006785036,0.002307261,0.69453526,0.006519812,0.026549503,0.006658272,0.023123361,0.005684228,0.00455502,0.003373894,0.00702598,0.004522589,0.009135192,0.007890021,0.006153388,0.004412652,0.005937578,0.004296668,0.009503992,0.006585705,0.004987146,0.011395217,0.033072922,0.010933248,0.23289376,0.008596479,0.005894119,['fungia fungites'],[0.0],[0]

One way of achieving this is by the ad- sorption of specialized macromolecules on specific planes of the growing crystals. With continued growth of the crystal, the macromolecules are incorporated inside the crystal bulk. Their presence does not change the crystal structure, but creates discontinuities in the perfect lattice. Here we study in detail three unusual cases of reduction in symmetry at the level of crys- tal domain shapes, induced by this con- trolled intercalation. We examined sponge spicules, which are single crystals of Mg- bearing calcite. They were specifically chosen for this study, because their mor- phologies do not reflect the hexagonal symmetry of calcite. Their crystal textures (coherence lengths and angular spreads) were characterized by high-resolution X- ray diffraction with well-collimated syn- chrotron radiation. The results are com- pared to analogous studies of synthetic calcite and Mg-bearing calcite. In all the selected spicules reduction in symmetry is observed in the coherence lengths among symmetry-related crystallographic direc- tions. The reconstructed shapes of the do- mains of perfect structure closely match the specific spicule morphologies. The synthetic crystals show no such reduction in symmetry. Although the manner by which such exquisite control is achieved is not known, we envisage it involving a combination of oriented nucleation with either physical or stereochemically driven adsorption.",0.08056574,0.017596541,0.7219283,0.020497965,0.020645233,0.013579154,0.019567244,0.07208439,0.11761278,0.026596984,0.020224674,0.8504869,0.011787731,0.023717858,0.009752586,0.022109438,0.024817852,0.015227686,0.045764547,0.020814624,0.02636504,0.032779247,0.037293192,0.054102063,0.018890776,0.02439304,0.004653767,0.027900036,0.033688612,"['fish', 'fishes']","[0.057142857142857, 0.057142857142857]","[1.0, 1.0]"

In most cases, these biofilms are resistant to antimicrobial therapy and eventually necessitate removal or replacement of the device. An engineered surface microtopography based on the skin of sharks, Sharklet AFTM, has been designed on a poly(dimethyl siloxane) elastomer (PDMSe) to disrupt the formation of bacterial biofilms without the use of bactericidal agents. The Sharklet AFTM PDMSe was tested against smooth PDMSe for biofilm formation of Staphylococcus aureus over the course of 21 days. The smooth surface exhibited early-stage biofilm colonies at 7 days and mature biofilms at 14 days, while the topographical surface did not show evidence of early biofilm colonization until day 21. At 14 days, the mean value of percent area coverage of S. aureus on the smooth surface was 54% compared to 7% for the Sharklet AFTM surface (p<0.01).

Many mammalian herbivores continually face the possibility of being poisoned by the natural toxins in the plants they consume. A recent key discovery in this area is that mammalian herbivores are capable of regulating the dose of plant secondary compounds (PSCs) ingested. 2. The ‘regulation model’ describes the factors driving ingestion of PSCs by mammals and can be dissected into two separate hypotheses related to meal size and inter-meal interval (IMI). Testing these hypotheses independently yields a more thorough understanding of the underlying and potentially interconnected mechanisms. 3. Three mechanisms could influence the size of meals that contain PSCs. These are the plasma concentration of PSCs, conditioned learning, and activation of bitter receptors in the intestine. 4. Two mechanisms are proposed to govern the IMI. The first predicts that IMI is dependent on the concentration of PSC metabolites in the plasma; feeding will not resume until metabolite concentrations are acceptable for further ingestion of PSCs. The second hypothesis proposes that the intestinal bitter receptors modulate IMI through release of satiety compounds.",0.018171223,0.005584033,0.011312443,0.022048468,0.01577996,0.011672545,0.008525482,0.013690515,0.013862344,0.008156673,0.8969436,0.01603956,0.03808096,0.007382492,0.012153454,0.023617169,0.005425266,0.009582401,0.017331276,0.015657583,0.018872377,0.010831147,0.034862734,0.018083788,0.01262954,0.021511028,0.01098457,0.012013094,0.00610158,"['plants', 'morus', 'morus indica']","[0.009615384615384, 0.009615384615384, 0.009615384615384]","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0]"

We found that bone volume fraction does not scale substantially with animal size, while trabeculae in larger animals' femora are thicker, further apart and fewer per unit volume than in smaller animals.

Tropoelastin is the soluble precursor to elastin, the main elastic protein found in mammals. Little is known of the shape and mechanism of assembly of tropoelastin as its unique composition and propensity to self-associate has hampered structural studies. In this study, we solve the nanostructure of full-length and corresponding overlapping fragments of tropoelastin using small angle X-ray and neutron scattering, allowing us to identify discrete regions of the molecule. Tropoelastin is an asymmetric coil, with a protruding foot that encompasses the C-terminal cell interaction motif.

Recent evidence suggests that aquaporin (AQP) water channels play critical roles in protecting cells from osmotic damage during freezing and desiccation. Our study sequenced, functionally characterized and measured the tissue abundance of an AQP from freeze-tolerant larvae of the gall fly, Eurosta solidaginis (Diptera: Tephritidae). The newly characterized EsAQP1 contains two NPA motifs and six transmembrane regions, and is phylogenetically related to an AQP from the anhydrobiotic chironomid Polypedilum vanderplanki. Using a Xenopus laevis oocyte swelling assay, we demonstrated that EsAQP1 increases water permeability to nine times that of simple diffusion through the membrane. In contrast to its high water permeability, EsAQP1 was impermeable to both glycerol and urea. The abundance of EsAQP1 increased from October to December in all tissues tested and was most abundant in the brain of winter larvae. Because the nervous system is thought to be the primary site of freezing injury, EsAQP1 may cryoprotect the brain from damage associated with water imbalance. The sequence, phylogenetic relationship, osmotic permeability, tissue distribution and seasonal abundance of EsAQP1 further support the role of AQPs in promoting freezing tolerance.",0.9537568,0.008841909,0.023495039,0.022646459,0.008368641,0.012155504,0.007327161,0.004179469,0.004084427,0.016949534,0.013304099,0.012013711,0.009159641,0.018355142,0.008216347,0.010199206,0.005899617,0.011029798,0.022655997,0.02010208,0.009896171,0.010359647,0.013409291,0.009103936,0.009612049,0.007156013,0.006877381,0.011778414,0.013622996,"['hedera helix', 'english ivy']","[0.017543859649122, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0]"

'Supercontraction' describes the dramatic shrinking of dragline silk fibers when wetted. In restrained silk fibers, supercontraction generates substantial stresses of 40-50 MPa above a critical humidity of approximately 70% relative humidity (RH). This stress may maintain tension in webs under the weight of rain or dew and could be used in industry for robotics, sensor technology, and other applications. Our own findings indicate that supercontraction can generate stress over a much broader range than previously reported, from 10 to 140 MPa. Here we show that this variation in supercontraction stress depends upon the rate at which the environment reaches the critical level of humidity causing supercontraction. Slow humidity increase, over several minutes, leads to relatively low supercontraction stress, while fast humidity increase, over a few seconds, typically results in higher supercontraction stress. Slowly supercontracted fibers take up less water and differ in thermostability from rapidly supercontracted fibers, as shown by thermogravimetric analysis. This suggests that spider silk achieves different molecular configurations depending upon the speed at which supercontraction occurs. Ultimately, rate-dependent supercontraction may provide a mechanism to tailor the properties of silk or biomimetic fibers for various applications.",0.025663015,0.050043985,0.03363378,0.034827325,0.05002191,0.027524456,0.046726204,0.030194096,0.022672374,0.06874655,0.032539397,0.03739869,0.058444425,0.03805235,0.025709579,0.037819967,0.026251186,0.03450528,0.02459401,0.03795914,0.04704592,0.017423144,0.044241898,0.03736592,0.8530681,0.04673248,0.8449671,0.86055356,0.038873553,[],[],[]

Scanning electron microscope observations show that the mosquito proboscis consists of a small bundle of long, tapering, and feeding stylets that are collectively called the fascicle, and a large scaly outer lower lip called the labium. During blood feeding, only the fascicle penetrates into the skin while the labium buckles back to remain on the surface of the skin. Here, we measured the dynamic force of penetration of the fascicle into human skin to reveal the mechanical principle underlying the painless process of penetration. High-speed video observations of movements associated with insertion of the fascicle indicate that the ""smart"" mosquito does not directly pierce its victim's skin with the fascicle. Instead, it uses the two maxillas as variable frequency microsaws with nanosharp teeth to advance into the skin tissue. This elegant BMEMS enables the mosquito to insert its feeding fascicle into human skin using an exceedingly small force (average of 16.5 μN).",0.015750594,0.01109502,0.012281903,0.007017379,0.008370125,0.018539736,0.012825608,0.009443344,0.012928017,0.029181924,0.004332063,0.010185496,0.008638357,0.012366284,0.009469437,0.01872062,0.016340528,0.007380081,0.006175252,0.016281905,0.018502995,0.00805379,0.02271395,0.011346047,0.008748638,0.01131306,0.01352532,0.013906145,0.94022244,['spiders'],[0.08333333333333301],[1.0]

This raises the question of why a particular circuit architecture is selected to implement a given cellular process. To investigate this problem, we compared the Bacillus subtilis circuit that regulates differentiation into the competence state to an engineered circuit with an alternative architecture (SynEx) in silico and in vivo. Time-lapse microscopy measurements showed that SynEx cells generated competence dynamics similar to native cells and reconstituted the physiology of differentiation. However, architectural differences between the circuits altered the dynamic distribution of stochastic fluctuations (noise) during circuit operation. This distinction in noise causes functional differences between the circuits by selectively controlling the timing of competence episodes and response of the system to various DNA concentrations.

A remarkable example is the formation of 3D wrinkles in bacterial biofilms growing on soft substrates, which may enhance the availability of nutrients and signaling molecules. To investigate the formation of biofilm wrinkle patterns, we developed a chemomechanical model that incorporates nutrient-limited inhomogeneous growth, surface friction, and the ensuing mechanical stresses and deformations. We predict the spatiotemporal stress field in a growing biofilm and how it dictates the formation of 3D biofilm morphology. Our model provides insight into the observed stages of expansion of Vibrio cholerae biofilms and suggests that universal mechanical principles may underlie the formation of 3D morphologies in biofilms across species. During development, organisms acquire three-dimensional (3D) shapes with important physiological consequences. While basic mechanisms underlying morphogenesis are known in eukaryotes, it is often difficult to manipulate them in vivo. To circumvent this issue, here we present a study of developing Vibrio cholerae biofilms grown on agar substrates in which the spatiotemporal morphological patterns were altered by varying the agar concentration. Expanding biofilms are initially flat but later undergo a mechanical instability and become wrinkled. To gain mechanistic insights into this dynamic pattern-formation process, we developed a model that considers diffusion of nutrients and their uptake by bacteria, bacterial growth/biofilm matrix production, mechanical deformation of both the biofilm and the substrate, and the friction between them. Our model shows quantitative agreement with experimental measurements of biofilm expansion dynamics, and it accurately predicts two distinct spatiotemporal patterns observed in the experiments—the wrinkles initially appear either in the peripheral region and propagate inward (soft substrate/low friction) or in the central region and propagate outward (stiff substrate/high friction). Our results, which establish that nonuniform growth and friction are fundamental determinants of stress anisotropy and hence biofilm morphology, are broadly applicable to bacterial biofilms with similar morphologies and also provide insight into how other bacterial biofilms form distinct wrinkle patterns. We discuss the implications of forming undulated biofilm morphologies, which may enhance the availability of nutrients and signaling molecules and serve as a “bet hedging” strategy.",0.035904307,0.010930851,0.80922085,0.013257584,0.019677227,0.012557467,0.013570688,0.043473944,0.037280798,0.020989742,0.026044454,0.017364612,0.017050568,0.012233718,0.03533377,0.014260978,0.01625323,0.008428768,0.01147196,0.019400222,0.013840647,0.014252367,0.013637207,0.86934537,0.019645313,0.012844918,0.006441318,0.014738139,0.019219153,"['sandfish', 'lime']","[0.020408163265306003, 0.020408163265306003]","[1.0, 1.0]"

Optimal escape theory holds that an animal confronted with a predator should only flee when benefits of flight (increased survival) outweigh the costs (energetic costs, lost foraging time, etc.). We propose a model for prey risk assessment based on the predator's stage of attack. Risk level should increase rapidly from when the predator detects the prey to when it commits to the attack. We tested this hypothesis using a predator – the echolocating bat – whose active biosonar reveals its stage of attack. We used a prey defense – clicking used for sonar jamming by the tiger moth Bertholdia trigona– that can be readily studied in the field and laboratory and is enacted simultaneously with evasive flight. We predicted that prey employ defenses soon after being detected and targeted, and that prey defensive thresholds discriminate between legitimate predatory threats and false threats where a nearby prey is attacked. Laboratory and field experiments using playbacks of ultrasound signals and naturally behaving bats, respectively, confirmed our predictions. Moths clicked soon after bats detected and targeted them. Also, B. trigona clicking thresholds closely matched predicted optimal thresholds for discriminating legitimate and false predator threats for bats using search and approach phase echolocation – the period when bats are searching for and assessing prey. To our knowledge, this is the first quantitative study to correlate the sensory stimuli that trigger defensive behaviors with measurements of signals provided by predators during natural attacks in the field. We propose theoretical models for explaining prey risk assessment depending on the availability of cues that reveal a predator's stage of attack.",0.014287003,0.015750328,0.007138111,0.21275812,0.007173488,0.008714123,0.005695507,0.005200904,0.006935488,0.01650203,0.011425721,0.009458066,0.015320972,0.040323325,0.009759901,0.00417828,0.017735086,0.01898414,0.008427848,0.009813685,0.005781461,0.67550534,0.006262696,0.012591268,0.010337129,0.014594944,0.011107066,0.004943663,0.00673629,"['festuca arizonica', 'fungal endophyte']","[0.0, 0.0]","[0, 0]"
963,10.1038/NATURE05466,['Nature'],https://www.nature.com/articles/nature05466,Two chemosensory receptors together mediate carbon dioxide detection in Drosophila,"Blood-feeding insects, including the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae, use highly specialized and sensitive olfactory systems to locate their hosts. This is accomplished by detecting and following plumes of volatile host emissions, which include carbon dioxide (CO2). CO2 is sensed by a population of olfactory sensory neurons in the maxillary palps of mosquitoes and in the antennae of the more genetically tractable fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster. The molecular identity of the chemosensory CO2 receptor, however, remains unknown. Here we report that CO2-responsive neurons in Drosophila co-express a pair of chemosensory receptors, Gr21a and Gr63a, at both larval and adult life stages. We identify mosquito homologues of Gr21a and Gr63a, GPRGR22 and GPRGR24, and show that these are co-expressed in A. gambiae maxillary palps. We show that Gr21a and Gr63a together are sufficient for olfactory CO2-chemosensation in Drosophila. Ectopic expression of Gr21a and Gr63a together confers CO2 sensitivity on CO2-insensitive olfactory neurons, but neither gustatory receptor alone has this function. Mutant flies lacking Gr63a lose both electrophysiological and behavioural responses to CO2. Knowledge of the molecular identity of the insect olfactory CO2 receptors may spur the development of novel mosquito control strategies designed to take advantage of this unique and critical olfactory pathway. This in turn could bolster the worldwide fight against malaria and other insect-borne diseases.",0.015341034,0.018908473,0.006605204,0.7575092,0.005445031,0.010874191,0.005337666,0.0120389,0.007707298,0.02036011,0.0238365,0.020519665,0.022193326,0.06519535,0.012741583,0.004934254,0.006606455,0.011808612,0.009275424,0.008234092,0.00927532,0.04100065,0.020372387,0.009777946,0.009987223,0.008625548,0.005188453,0.012530534,0.015591207,"['brazilian free-tailed bat', 'free-tailed bats', 'tadarida brasiliensis', 'bats']","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.07142857142857101]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]"

Yet, until recently, researchers were unable to rigorously quantify the complex wing motions of flapping insects or measure the forces and flows around their wings. However, recent developments in high-speed videography and tools for computational and mechanical modeling have allowed researchers to make rapid progress in advancing our understanding of insect flight. These mechanical and computational fluid dynamic models, combined with modern flow visualization techniques, have revealed that the fluid dynamic phenomena underlying flapping flight are different from those of non-flapping, 2-D wings on which most previous models were based. In particular, even at high angles of attack, a prominent leading edge vortex remains stably attached on the insect wing and does not shed into an unsteady wake, as would be expected from non-flapping 2-D wings. Its presence greatly enhances the forces generated by the wing, thus enabling insects to hover or maneuver. In addition, flight forces are further enhanced by other mechanisms acting during changes in angle of attack, especially at stroke reversal, the mutual interaction of the two wings at dorsal stroke reversal or wing–wake interactions following stroke reversal. This progress has enabled the development of simple analytical and empirical models that allow us to calculate the instantaneous forces on flapping insect wings more accurately than was previously possible. It also promises to foster new and exciting multi-disciplinary collaborations between physicists who seek to explain the phenomenology, biologists who seek to understand its relevance to insect physiology and evolution, and engineers who are inspired to build micro-robotic insects using these principles. This review covers the basic physical principles underlying flapping flight in insects, results of recent experiments concerning the aerodynamics of insect flight, as well as the different approaches used to model these phenomena.",0.010448428,0.010584476,0.014237978,0.009082998,0.019905783,0.0210843,0.015181034,0.007559702,0.014606711,0.009479438,0.004982473,0.007996489,0.01399688,0.021516338,0.009214789,0.005740125,0.85254717,0.011881745,0.011920048,0.019097475,0.020834357,0.016688967,0.023780609,0.010685997,0.010248142,0.010288461,0.007918004,0.00723576,0.018535405,"['beetles', 'suckers', 'spatula', 'diving beetles']","[0.026666666666666002, 0.013333333333333001, 0.053333333333333004, 0.013333333333333001]","[0.5, 0.25, 1.0, 0.25]"

We believe this is the first record of a natural, host-derived chemical molecule identified as a recognition cue for the phylum Myxozoa. The actinospores of these parasites attach to fish hosts via polar filaments that are extruded upon mechanical stimulation after preceding recognition of a chemical trigger contained in surface mucus. Our goal was to identify this signal. We separated compounds from a purified active fraction derived from trout mucus by a novel HPLC method. By subsequent nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of distinct components and testing in bioassays we elicited stimulation of polar filament discharge and sporoplasm emission in actinospores of three myxozoan spp., Myxobolus cerebralis, Myxobolus pseudodispar and Henneguya nuesslini, by the free nucleosides inosine, 2'-deoxyinosine and guanosine. These nucleosides also activated sporoplasm emission. Nucleosides appear to be appropriate cues for rapid host recognition by the waterborne parasite stages since they are continuously released into surface mucus. The recognition mechanism is not specific for susceptible host species, at least in the myxozoan spp. examined. In addition, a novel function of nucleobase derivatives as semiochemicals was uncovered and a wider impact of this molecule class in parasite recognition systems and aquatic chemical ecology is predicted.

Conidial germination and hyphal growth of P. corylea on the leaf surface of two susceptible mulberry genotypes, viz., Kanva 2 (K2) and Victory 1 (V1) varieties of Morus indica, and on two resistant species, viz., M. laevigata and M. serrata were studied by scanning electron microscopy. Conidial germination and growth of germ tubes were normal on all the leaves. The hyphae of P. coryleaidentify stomata on host leaves by their topographical features to produce the stomatopodia precisely over them. The holes and/or the grooves of stomata appear to provide the signals for the initiation of stomatopodia and similar structures are erratically developed over many local depressions or grooves on leaf surface. The abaxial surface of K2 leaf is smooth without prominent undulations of epidermal cell surface, and the stomata are flush with the leaf surface. Although successful penetration is also achieved on V1 leaf, its slightly undulated surface occasionally provides inaccurate tropic signals to the hyphae, inducing the development of stomatopodia away from the stomata. The leaf surfaces of M. laevigata and M. serrata are very rough with highly sculptured cuticle and abundant epidermal outgrowths. Stomata mostly remain sunken or hidden amidst the cuticular ornamentations and the hyphae fail to recognise the precise signals from them. As the surface architecture of the leaves provides many immense sources of tropic signals, stomatopodia are often produced over local depressions or grooves. In these cases the fungus fails to penetrate the leaf, does not develop beyond 24 h and penetration is rarely achieved on the leaves of the resistant plants. The study indicates that the stimulatory effect of the leaf surface topography of resistant varieties misleads the pathogen from successful penetration, thus contributing to the plant's resistance.",0.06725574,0.004949804,0.007049932,0.003251867,0.005877906,0.002469665,0.011486608,0.002639706,0.006303313,0.007537012,0.006898609,0.009423221,0.004436631,0.009842915,0.008103118,0.03929401,0.00643828,0.005384951,0.023043115,0.005733535,0.007003265,0.015489208,0.00376443,0.007137255,0.003222836,0.21732561,0.002986034,0.008506962,0.009641444,[],[],[]

African wild dogs exhibit dominant-directed group living and take part in stereotyped social rallies: high energy greeting ceremonies that occur before collective movements. Not all rallies result in collective movements, for reasons that are not well understood. We show that the probability of rally success (i.e. group departure) is predicted by a minimum number of audible rapid nasal exhalations (sneezes), within the rally. Moreover, the number of sneezes needed for the group to depart (i.e. the quorum) was reduced whenever dominant individuals initiated rallies, suggesting that dominant participation increases the likelihood of a rally's success, but is not a prerequisite. As such, the ‘will of the group’ may override dominant preferences when the consensus of subordinates is sufficiently great.

Plants and their associated bacteria interact with each other whereby plant supplies the bacteria with a special carbon source that stimulates the bacteria to degrade organic contaminants in the soil. In return, plant associated-bacteria can support their host plant to overcome contaminated-induced stress responses, and improve plant growth and development. In addition, plants further get benefits from their associated-bacteria possessing hydrocarbon-degradation potential, leading to enhanced hydrocarbon mineralization and lowering of both phytotoxicity and evapotranspiration of volatile hydrocarbons. A better understanding of plant-bacteria partnerships could be exploited to enhance the remediation of hydrocarbon contaminated soils in conjunction with sustainable production of non-food crops for biomass and biofuel production.",0.009877393,0.009612575,0.012158332,0.013877696,0.007636126,0.008328784,0.007126822,0.015623309,0.01209512,0.010380548,0.019354274,0.00783715,0.8943294,0.009022335,0.010750026,0.004641139,0.010001713,0.010000736,0.007864731,0.01336577,0.009940744,0.010210004,0.009518237,0.009089014,0.013262208,0.016074328,0.010085178,0.008914231,0.010196341,[],[],[]

Hydrophone measurements in conjunction with time-controlled high-speed imaging of the claw closure demonstrate that the sound is emitted at the cavitation bubble collapse and not on claw closure.

These beetles have adhesive setae on their feet that produce a secretory fluid having a crucial role in adhesion on land. In air, adhesion is produced by capillary forces between the fluid-covered setae and the substrate. In general, capillary forces do not contribute to adhesion under water. However, our observations showed that these beetles may use air bubbles trapped between their adhesive setae to walk on flooded, inclined substrata or even under water. Beetle adhesion to hydrophilic surfaces under water was lower than that in air, whereas adhesion to hydrophobic surfaces under water was comparable to that in air. Oil-covered hairy pads had a pinning effect, retaining the air bubbles on their feet. Bubbles in contact with the hydrophobic substrate de-wetted the substrate and produced capillary adhesion. Additional capillary forces are generated by the pad's liquid bridges between the foot and the substrate.

In this species, the skeleton comprises an elaborate cylindrical lattice-like structure with at least six hierarchical levels spanning the length scale from nanometers to centimeters. The basic building blocks are laminated skeletal elements (spicules) that consist of a central proteinaceous axial filament surrounded by alternating concentric domains of consolidated silica nanoparticles and organic interlayers. Two intersecting grids of non-planar cruciform spicules define a locally quadrate, globally cylindrical skeletal lattice that provides the framework onto which other skeletal constituents are deposited. The grids are supported by bundles of spicules that form vertical, horizontal and diagonally ordered struts. The overall cylindrical lattice is capped at its upper end by a terminal sieve plate and rooted into the sea floor at its base by a flexible cluster of barbed fibrillar anchor spicules. External diagonally oriented spiral ridges that extend perpendicular to the surface further strengthen the lattice.

Although such experimental work suggests that many species of shorebird may be capable of surface-tension feeding, no field studies have been done that examine this possibility. We studied the occurrence and interspecific variation in the performance of surface-tension transport (STT) in wild shorebirds feeding on identical prey items in shallow water. All shorebirds videotaped—Little Stint (C. minuta), Dunlin (C. alpina), Sanderling (C. alba), Curlew Sandpiper (C. ferruginea), Common Redshank (Tringa totanus), and Black-winged Stilt (Himantopus himantopus)—used STT to feed on small prey items. Individuals employing STT used one or several cycles of jaw spreading to transport the prey contained in a drop of water upward along the bill cavity, an action indicative of STT. Two distinct types of prey transport were observed: (1) use of STT in isolation by calidridine species following the description given in previous studies (i.e., an absence of other feeding mechanisms such as tongue movements, suction, or inertial transport), and (2) STT aided by inertial transport (head jerks) as seen in Common Redshank and Black-winged Stilt. Measured prey-transport variables (number of cycles, total time, and speed of transport) varied among species. The absence of significant relationships between these variables and measures of external morphology (bill length, bill length-to-width ratio, and bill length-to-depth ratio) suggests that some interspecific variations in STT performance may be attributable to differences in internal bill morphology. We show that STT is a common feeding mechanism in small or medium- sized shorebird species that feed on small prey items in shallow water. Birds using STT transported ≤3.6× faster than the theoretical value predicted by a previous model and can achieve high intake rates when foraging on high densities of available small prey items.

This study investigates how these changes in blubber morphology and composition influence its thermal properties. Thermal conductivity (W m–1 deg.–1, where deg. is °C) and thermal insulation (m2 deg. W–1) of dolphin blubber were measured in individuals across an ontogenetic series (fetus through adult, N=36), pregnant females (N=4) and emaciated animals (N=5). These thermal properties were determined by the simultaneous use of two common experimental approaches, the heat flux disc method and the standard material method. Thickness, lipid and water content were measured for each blubber sample. Thermal conductivity and insulation varied significantly across ontogeny. Blubber from fetuses through sub-adults was less conductive (range=0.11–0.13±0.02 W m–1 deg.–1) than that of adults (mean=0.18 W m–1 deg.–1). The conductivity of blubber from pregnant females was similar to non-adult categories, while that of emaciated animals was significantly higher (0.24 ± 0.04 W m deg.–1) than all other categories. Blubber from sub-adults and pregnant females had the highest insulation values while fetuses and emaciated animals had the lowest. In nutritionally dependant life history categories, changes in blubber's thermal insulation were characterized by stable blubber quality (i.e. conductivity) and increased blubber quantity (i.e. thickness). In nutritionally independent animals, blubber quantity remained stable while blubber quality varied. A final, unexpected observation was that heat flux measurements at the deep blubber surface were significantly higher than that at the superficial surface, a pattern not observed in control materials. This apparent ability to absorb heat, coupled with blubber's fatty acid composition, suggest that dolphin integument may function as a phase change material.",0.005814367,0.007179533,0.006228036,0.003690003,0.009625335,0.212977,0.003627408,0.004044223,0.03220379,0.004114618,0.005533034,0.002939167,0.005273236,0.00282455,0.003624438,0.004092632,0.007247975,0.007166296,0.003162733,0.017862435,0.005424468,0.00442461,0.14581642,0.004519756,0.004092586,0.005211142,0.005517628,0.003302339,0.003445689,['arapaima'],[0.020408163265306003],[1.0]

The energy transfer mechanism is often described by semiclassical models that invoke ‘hopping’ of excited-state populations along discrete energy levels. Two-dimensional Fourier transform electronic spectroscopy has mapped these energy levels and their coupling in the Fenna–Matthews–Olson (FMO) bacteriochlorophyll complex, which is found in green sulphur bacteria and acts as an energy ‘wire’ connecting a large peripheral light-harvesting antenna, the chlorosome, to the reaction centre. The spectroscopic data clearly document the dependence of the dominant energy transport pathways on the spatial properties of the excited-state wavefunctions of the whole bacteriochlorophyll complex. But the intricate dynamics of quantum coherence, which has no classical analogue, was largely neglected in the analyses—even though electronic energy transfer involving oscillatory populations of donors and acceptors was first discussed more than 70 years ago, and electronic quantum beats arising from quantum coherence in photosynthetic complexes have been predicted and indirectly observed. Here we extend previous two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy investigations of the FMO bacteriochlorophyll complex, and obtain direct evidence for remarkably long-lived electronic quantum coherence playing an important part in energy transfer processes within this system. The quantum coherence manifests itself in characteristic, directly observable quantum beating signals among the excitons within the Chlorobium tepidum FMO complex at 77 K. This wavelike characteristic of the energy transfer within the photosynthetic complex can explain its extreme efficiency, in that it allows the complexes to sample vast areas of phase space to find the most efficient path.",0.13407545,0.01134378,0.012455841,0.004963868,0.003972151,0.00300794,0.002494422,0.012742951,0.00420426,0.012808227,0.004421983,0.012758629,0.005424898,0.006873191,0.004822847,0.003430544,0.003739032,0.03171801,0.049432285,0.007869455,0.011995217,0.01267583,0.009205233,0.005286499,0.002412753,0.002011397,0.00298984,0.003585611,0.006667854,"['humans', 'human']","[0.05, 0.05]","[1.0, 1.0]"

The morphology of the flipper from a 9.02‐m whale was evaluated with regard to this hydrodynamic function. The flipper had a wing‐like, high aspect ratio plan‐form. Rounded tubercles were regularly interspersed along the flipper's leading edge. The flipper was cut into 71 2.5‐cm cross‐sections and photographed. Except for sections near the distal tip, flipper sections were symmetrical with no camber. Flipper sections had a blunt, rounded leading edge and a highly tapered trailing edge. Placement of the maximum thickness placement for each cross‐section varied from 49% of chord at the tip to 19% at mid‐span. Section thickness ratio averaged 0.23 with a range of 0.20–0.28. The humpback whale flipper had a cross‐sectional design typical of manufactured aerodynamic foils for lift generation. The morphology and placement of leading edge tubercles sugges that they function as enhanced lift devices to control flow over the flipper and maintain lift at high angles of attack.

More than 400 different fungi were isolated from Arizona fescue. However, most of these were extremely rare and isolated only once. Neoty- phodium starrii and 13 other morphospecies com- prised the majority of fungal taxa.

The diversity and dominance of non-Neotyphodium endophytes were highly variable among Arizona fescue populations and varied season- ally and yearly within and among populations. Most of these fungal species are probably opportunistic colonizers that increase in abundance in late summer with seasonal rains that promote spore transmission and germination and hyphal growth.

The slime is formed via the interaction between seawater and two components released by the slime glands: mucin vesicles from gland mucous cells, which swell and rupture in seawater to form a network of mucus strands, and intermediate filament-rich threads, which are produced within gland thread cells as tightly coiled bundles called skeins. A previous study showed that the unraveling of skeins from Atlantic hagfish (Myxine glutinosa) requires both the presence of mucins and hydrodynamic mixing. In contrast, skeins from Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stoutii) unravel in the absence of both mucins and mixing. We tested the hypothesis that spontaneous unraveling of E. stoutii skeins is triggered by the dissolution of a seawater-soluble protein adhesive and the release of stored strain energy within the coiled thread. Here we show that, as predicted by this hypothesis, unraveling can be initiated by a protease under conditions in which unraveling does not normally occur. We also demonstrate, using high resolution scanning electron microscopy, that the treatment of skeins with solutions that cause unraveling also leads to the disappearance of surface and inter-thread features that remain when skeins are washed with stabilizing solutions. Our study provides a mechanism for the deployment of thread skeins in Pacific hagfish slime, and raises the possibility of producing novel biomimetic protein adhesives that are salt, temperature and kosmotrope sensitive.",0.023782576,0.017260635,0.8829703,0.013300069,0.028263139,0.030618312,0.014949788,0.028815176,0.9144089,0.011698802,0.020677082,0.028621731,0.024085807,0.007511897,0.018874062,0.014945063,0.019346394,0.013837349,0.014263728,0.02394655,0.022108262,0.015531744,0.029984433,0.041830845,0.010051619,0.011960106,0.007216245,0.019066285,0.014969449,['plants'],[0.017857142857142003],[1.0]

More than 80% of the energy consumed during flight generates heat as a by-product, and thus it is expected that bat wings should dissipate large amounts of heat to prevent hyperthermia. We measured rectal (Tr) and surface (Ts) temperatures of Brazilian free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) as they emerged from and returned to their daytime roosts and calculated sensible heat transfer for different body regions (head, body, wings, and tail membrane). Bats’ Tr decreased from 36.8°C during emergence flights to 34.4°C during returns, and Ts scaled positively with ambient temperature (Ta). Total radiative heat loss from bats was significantly greater for a radiative sink to the night sky than for a sink with temperature equal to Ta. We found that free-ranging Brazilian free-tailed bats, on average, do not dissipate heat from their wings by convection but instead dissipate radiative heat (L) to the cloudless night sky during flight ( W). However, within the range of Ta measured in this study, T. brasiliensis experienced net heat loss between evening emergence and return flights. Regional hypothermia reduces heat loss from wings that are exposed to potentially high convective fluxes. Additional research is needed to establish the role of wings in evaporative cooling during flight in bats.",0.008005569,0.014313136,0.006974695,0.004565561,0.008864851,0.010696316,0.008446514,0.005742169,0.008683092,0.006383525,0.01082003,0.005963754,0.0068776,0.005173551,0.003782339,0.015046876,0.006429516,0.007368786,0.00627283,0.007345316,0.009931419,0.006074916,0.9411286,0.003759466,0.008255795,0.00813319,0.006240218,0.0085599,0.010394542,"['insects', 'wood frog', 'frogs']","[0.021052631578947, 0.010526315789473, 0.031578947368421005]","[0.6666666666666661, 0.33333333333333304, 1.0]"

This coevolution of male setae and female elytra has attracted much attention since Darwin. However, there has been little examination of their biomechanical functioning despite increasing knowledge on biofibrillar adhesion. Here, we report and compare, for the first time, the mechanisms of underwater attachment using two hair types, the primitive spatula and derived ‘passive’ sucker, found in male diving beetles. Results from interspecific scaling of protarsal palettes and adhesion by single seta suggest better performance in the later-evolved circular (sucker) setae. Spatula setae with a modified shallow sucker and channels use the combined mechanisms of suction and viscous resistance for adhesion. Velocity-dependent adhesion provides sufficient control for resisting the female's erratic movements while also detaching easily through slow peeling. Direction-dependent shear resistance helps reorient setae surfaces into a preferred direction for effective adhesion. Seta deformation using different mechanisms for circular and spatula setae reduces the force that is transmitted to the contact interface. A softer spring in spatula setae explains their adhesion at lower preloads and assists in complete substrate contact. Attachment mechanisms revealed in adhesive setae with modified spatula and passive suckers provide insights for bioinspired designs of underwater attachment devices.",0.012801175,0.005524492,0.010237208,0.01191391,0.010911922,0.013376088,0.004360929,0.007610629,0.011162957,0.91338336,0.006398056,0.011220677,0.006605216,0.011363739,0.020457076,0.00676029,0.004806148,0.009905043,0.012083827,0.009645488,0.004370176,0.009286017,0.007615136,0.011128061,0.009588341,0.009078334,0.0083651,0.020042753,0.014612739,[],[],[]

Both are primarily composed of type I collagen and a mineral phase (carbonated apatite), arranged in osteons in compact (cortical bone) sections and a lamellar structure in the cancellous (spongy or trabecular bone) sections. The mineral content is lower in antler bone and it has a core of cancellous bone surrounded by compact bone running through the main beam and tines. The mineral content is higher in the compact compared with the cancellous bone, although there is no difference in ratios of the mineral elements with calcium. Mechanical tests (bend and compression) on longitudinal and transverse orientations of dry and rehydrated compact bone of North American elk (Cervus elaphus canadensis) antlers are compared with known data on other antlers as well as bovine femora. Both dry and rehydrated bones are highly anisotropic, with the bending and compressive strength and elastic modulus higher in the longitudinal than in the transverse direction. There is no significant difference between the bend strength and elastic modulus between dry and rehydrated samples tested in the transverse direction. The elastic modulus measured from the bending tests is compared with composite models. The elastic modulus and bend strengths are lower in the rehydrated condition, but the strain to failure and fracture toughness is much higher compared with dry samples.

Disease-suppressive soils are exceptional ecosystems in which crop plants suffer less from specific soil-borne pathogens than expected owing to the activities of other soil microorganisms. For most disease-suppressive soils, the microbes and mechanisms involved in pathogen control are unknown. By coupling PhyloChip-based metagenomics of the rhizosphere microbiome with culture-dependent functional analyses, we identified key bacterial taxa and genes involved in suppression of a fungal root pathogen. More than 33,000 bacterial and archaeal species were detected, with Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria consistently associated with disease suppression. Members of the γ-Proteobacteria were shown to have disease-suppressive activity governed by nonribosomal peptide synthetases.

Alternaria sp. is a saprophytic fungus isolated from a forest soil. We examined the precipitation of CaCO3 induced by the fungus in response to different levels of Ca(NO3)2 or CaCl2 in agar media, and the biogenesis of CaCO3 was verified by low δ13C value. The formed CaCO3 was identified as calcite by X-ray diffraction analysis. Square, rectangular and rhombic CaCO3 crystals and amorphous calcium carbonate were observed around mycelia at higher levels of Ca(NO3)2. Acidification occurred in media at low concentrations (0 and 0.0002 M) of Ca(NO3)2, and no CaCO3 formed in these media. The quantities of CaCO3 formed in media increased with increasing concentrations of Ca(NO3)2 and were significantly correlated to fungal biomass, pH value and nitrite concentrations. No CaCO3 was formed in media with CaCl2 at all levels. These results collectively indicated that the formation of CaCO3 can be induced by the fungal assimilation of nitrate.

In the species examined so far, stroke amplitude is large, and most of the aerodynamic force is produced halfway through a stroke when translation velocities are highest. Here we demonstrate that honeybees use an alternative strategy, hovering with relatively low stroke amplitude (approximately 90 degrees) and high wingbeat frequency (approximately 230 Hz). When measured on a dynamically scaled robot, the kinematics of honeybee wings generate prominent force peaks during the beginning, middle, and end of each stroke, indicating the importance of additional unsteady mechanisms at stroke reversal. When challenged to fly in low-density heliox, bees responded by maintaining nearly constant wingbeat frequency while increasing stroke amplitude by nearly 50%. We examined the aerodynamic consequences of this change in wing motion by using artificial kinematic patterns in which amplitude was systematically increased in 5 degrees increments. To separate the aerodynamic effects of stroke velocity from those due to amplitude, we performed this analysis under both constant frequency and constant velocity conditions. The results indicate that unsteady forces during stroke reversal make a large contribution to net upward force during hovering but play a diminished role as the animal increases stroke amplitude and flight power. We suggest that the peculiar kinematics of bees may reflect either a specialization for increasing load capacity or a physiological limitation of their flight muscles.",0.010885084,0.012478654,0.015071015,0.010685235,0.018157076,0.025758734,0.015829412,0.007391093,0.013285516,0.010172193,0.005269403,0.008907885,0.014461282,0.02267714,0.009323256,0.005675072,0.8702632,0.012143726,0.011931538,0.02537571,0.019796005,0.01867789,0.023226941,0.011978,0.010362302,0.011084693,0.007697727,0.007916375,0.019146461,['daffodil'],[0.057142857142857],[1.0]

While overwintering beneath the bark of fallen trees, C. c. puniceus larvae may experience low ambient temperatures of around –40°C (and lower) when microhabitat is un-insulated because of low snow cover.

The content of the methylxanthines, caffeine and theobromine, in the leaf increased in the initial translucent stage of the disease, probably as a defense response to fungal attack. Epicatechin and epigallocatechin levels were less than in healthy tissues at this stage, but increases in the corresponding gallate esters suggested that they were being converted into esters. Although epicatechin and epigallocatechin levels decreased from translucent to mature blister stages, the decrease was not significant. The decrease in levels of epicatechin, epigallocatechin, and their esters on infection and the formation of cyanidin and delphinidin on oxidative depolymerization of the blisters suggests that proanthocyanidins may play a role in the defense mechanism.

The literature on plant–herbivore interactions focuses on plant trait mean values, but recent studies showing the importance of plant genetic diversity for herbivores suggest that plant trait variance may be equally important. The consequences of plant trait variance for herbivore performance, however, have been largely overlooked. Here we report an extensive assessment of the effects of within-population plant trait variance on herbivore performance using 457 performance datasets from 53 species of insect herbivores. We show that variance in plant nutritive traits substantially reduces mean herbivore performance via non-linear averaging of performance relationships that were overwhelmingly concave down. By contrast, relationships between herbivore performance and plant defence levels were typically linear, with variance in plant defence not affecting herbivore performance via non-linear averaging. Our results demonstrate that plants contribute to the suppression of herbivore populations through variable nutrient levels, not just by having low average quality as is typically thought. We propose that this phenomenon could play a key role in the suppression of herbivore populations in natural systems, and that increased nutrient heterogeneity within agricultural crops could contribute to the sustainable control of insect pests in agroecosystems.",0.034465235,0.026872497,0.014427003,0.071895115,0.016128188,0.007933659,0.012996767,0.011215615,0.010041347,0.01723646,0.005348758,0.011126776,0.0141045,0.8878771,0.013469371,0.014940993,0.037904046,0.020847265,0.033547144,0.007571098,0.00857912,0.015410764,0.016312147,0.014251723,0.023005879,0.012065352,0.017349297,0.017191656,0.020681947,"['abalone', 'red abalone']","[0.03125, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0]"

However, relationships involving leaf area, leaf shape and plant height remain poorly resolved. Previous work has also focused on correlations between average trait values for individual species. It is unclear whether similar relationships occur within species.We searched for novel plant trait correlations by comparing leaf area, leaf circularity, specific leaf area (SLA) and plant height among 16 common woody plant species from a temperate forest in New Zealand. Analyses were conducted both within species (intra-specifically) and among species (inter-specifically) to determine whether trait correlations were scale dependent. Leaf area was unrelated to other leaf traits inter-specifically. However, leaf area declined with plant height and increased with SLA intra- specifically.

Most prominent is a sometimes-dramatic amount of gene loss and genome reduction. Recently, highly reduced genomes from the co-resident intracellular symbionts of sharpshooters were shown to exhibit a striking level of metabolic interdependence. One symbiont, called Sulcia muelleri (Bacteroidetes), can produce eight of the 10 essential amino acids, despite having a genome of only 245 kb. The other, Baumannia cicadellinicola (γ-Proteobacteria), can produce the remaining two essential amino acids as well as many vitamins. Cicadas also contain the symbiont Sulcia, but lack Baumannia and instead contain the co-resident symbiont Hodgkinia cicadicola (α-Proteobacteria). Here we report that, despite at least 200 million years of divergence, the two Sulcia genomes have nearly identical gene content and gene order. Additionally, we show that despite being phylogenetically distant and drastically different in genome size and architecture, Hodgkinia and Baumannia have converged on gene sets conferring similar capabilities for essential amino acid biosynthesis, in both cases precisely complementary to the pathways conserved in Sulcia. In contrast, they have completely divergent capabilities for vitamin biosynthesis. Despite having the smallest gene set known in bacteria, Hodgkinia devotes at least 7% of its proteome to cobalamin (vitamin B12) biosynthesis, a significant metabolic burden. The presence of these genes can be explained by Hodgkinia's retention of the cobalamin-dependent version of methionine synthase instead of the cobalamin-independent version found in Baumannia, a situation that necessitates retention of cobalamin biosynthetic capabilities to make the essential amino acid methionine.",0.011827006,0.006438225,0.008609246,0.016727433,0.004880084,0.006167089,0.003761045,0.024033435,0.007360393,0.006928004,0.059889033,0.010609284,0.67555517,0.004919151,0.015923046,0.004722684,0.005374123,0.00914513,0.006381647,0.008862392,0.005471054,0.010664281,0.006831233,0.013329599,0.010424535,0.02543642,0.005666071,0.007785172,0.006318564,[],[],[]

When the slime exudate contacts seawater, the thread bundles unravel and the mucin vesicles swell and rupture. Little is known about the mechanisms of vesicle rupture in seawater and stabilization within the gland, although it is believed that the vesicle membrane is permeable to most ions except polyvalent anions. We hypothesized that the most abundant compounds within the slime gland exudate have a stabilizing effect on the mucin vesicles. To test this hypothesis, we measured the chemical composition of the fluid component of hagfish slime exudate and conducted functional assays with these solutes to test their ability to keep the vesicles in a condensed state. We found K+ concentrations that were elevated relative to plasma, and Na+, Cl− and Ca2+ concentrations that were considerably lower. Our analysis also revealed high levels of methylamines such as trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), betaine and dimethylglycine, which had a combined concentration of 388 mmol l−1 in the glandular fluid. In vitro rupture assays demonstrated that both TMAO and betaine had a significant effect on rupture, but neither was capable of completely abolishing mucin swelling and rupture, even at high concentrations. This suggests that some other mechanism such as the chemical microenvironment within gland mucous cells, or hydrostatic pressure is responsible for stabilization of the vesicles within the gland.",0.027570238,0.016529743,0.89754164,0.013138293,0.030449245,0.037915614,0.014599555,0.030252894,0.9130158,0.011959526,0.021824755,0.028802361,0.022787644,0.007926354,0.020310842,0.015908616,0.019467568,0.013645632,0.01731087,0.030446557,0.023505906,0.013041838,0.028834537,0.05168995,0.01018565,0.010868833,0.007021477,0.017888822,0.015850924,"['hornets', 'vespa', 'vespinae', 'hymenoptera', 'vespa orientalis', 'wasps', 'bowl', 'trachea']","[0.024691358024691003, 0.012345679012345002, 0.012345679012345002, 0.012345679012345002, 0.012345679012345002, 0.012345679012345002, 0.012345679012345002, 0.024691358024691003]","[1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0]"

Theoretically, the accumulation of a non-photosynthetic pigment competing with chlorophylls for photon capture would impose a photosynthetic cost, which should be paid off by the benefits afforded by anthocyanins under some circumstances. Hence, the proposed hypotheses presume protective functions against excess light, UV-B radiation, reactive oxygen species, water stress (osmoregulation) and herbivory. The existing arguments in favor of an anti-oxidant, anti-UV-B and osmoregulatory role are confounded by the co-occurrence in leaves of other compounds having the same properties, not absorbing visible light, attaining much higher concentrations and, in some cases, having a more appropriate location to fulfill the ascribed functions. Moreover, the excess light hypothesis should take into account that anthocyanins mainly absorb green photons, which are used photosynthetically in deeper cell layers needing less photoprotection. The more ecological, anti-herbivore hypotheses, consider red leaf color as a signal denoting high defensive commitment, as a camouflage obscuring the green reflectance indicative of a healthy leaf and/or as a device undermining the folivorous insects camouflage. The anti-herbivore hypotheses have not been thoroughly tested, yet they are compatible with the known optical preferences of insects and their underlying physiology. Overall, although a multiplicity of potential roles can be argued, the primary role may depend on the reference system, i.e. species, developmental stage or specific biotic and abiotic stressors.",0.033186547,0.014240756,0.003109928,0.019045401,0.004463163,0.002887872,0.002024213,0.007247811,0.019214444,0.008227686,0.010078516,0.06443905,0.003029656,0.011490501,0.003679227,0.006911369,0.002097831,0.03582391,0.0339946,0.003094934,0.003964804,0.015432308,0.008086153,0.004665326,0.002309942,0.007785522,0.003153651,0.019204292,0.002190839,"['plants', 'higher plants']","[0.012820512820512001, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0]"

Smaller plants exhibit an atmospheric habit, while larger plants form water-impounding tanks. The study of the functional significance of heteroblasty in epiphytes is severely hampered by considerable size-related variation in morphological, anatomical and physiological parameters. To overcome this problem, plants of varying size of both atmospheric and tank form were included in the present study with Vriesea sanguinolenta. The results show that virtually all morphological, anatomical and physiological characteristics vary during ontogeny, but changes were rarely directly related to the step change in gross morphology. Changes were either: (1) gradual from smallest atmospheric to small tank (e.g. leaf divergence angles, reduction in photosystem II efficiency during drought, speed of recovery after drought); (2) there was no change between atmospheric and small tank, but a gradual or step change within the tank form (stomatal density, relationship of leaf N and specific leaf area); or (3) developmental patterns were more complicated with decreases and increases during ontogeny (photosynthetic capacity, carbon isotope ratios, abscisic acid levels during drought). Although the comparisons between ontogenetic phases were always confounded by size differences, a hypothetical small tank plant is expected to suffer higher water loss than a real atmospheric, whereas a hypothetical, large atmospheric plant would show reduced access to resources, such as nutrients, in comparison with the real tank. The present results are consistent with the notion of heteroblasty as an adaptation of early ontogenetic stages to drought, but highlight that size-related variation greatly modifies any difference directly associated with the step change from atmospheric to tank.",0.9219882,0.008508245,0.017076176,0.012403104,0.007930578,0.009718132,0.006379882,0.004101265,0.003536001,0.013806274,0.010023195,0.008767051,0.008405475,0.014571311,0.00871795,0.0089133,0.005075159,0.009423034,0.017624348,0.01811297,0.008535433,0.007291162,0.011938984,0.007935258,0.008182475,0.005748202,0.006407484,0.009604825,0.010753373,"['globicephala', 'whale', 'globicephala melas']","[0.014705882352941001, 0.014705882352941001, 0.014705882352941001]","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0]"

By saving on inherent costs, individuals that do not contribute socially have a selective advantage over altruists if both types receive equal benefits. Restrained consumption of a common resource is a form of altruism. The cost of this kind of prudent behavior is that restrained individuals give up resources to less-restrained individuals. The benefit of restraint is that better resource management may prolong the persistence of the group. One way to dodge the problem of defection is for altruists to interact disproportionately with other altruists. With limited dispersal, restrained individuals persist because of interaction with like types, whereas it is the unrestrained individuals that must face the negative long-term consequences of their rapacity. Here, we study the evolution of restraint in a community of three competitors exhibiting a nontransitive (rock–paper–scissors) relationship. The nontransitivity ensures a form of negative feedback, whereby improvement in growth of one competitor has the counterintuitive consequence of lowering the density of that improved player. This negative feedback generates detrimental long-term consequences for unrestrained growth. Using both computer simulations and evolution experiments with a nontransitive community of Escherichia coli, we find that restrained growth can evolve under conditions of limited dispersal in which negative feedback is present.

But even more than 100 years after the first investigations of Ernst Stahl on the chemical defense of plants and mosses against slugs and snails we know very little about the nature and biosynthesis of metabolites responsible for moss chemical defense. Dicranum scoparium is an example of a well-defended moss; it is globally distributed in temperate and arctic forests and often occurs in dense patches that show no sign of herbivory. In a recent survey of the volatile oxylipins (products of the oxidative transformation of polyunsaturated fatty acids) from mosses, we identified D. scoparium as a prolific producer of such metabolites. In addition, this moss produces unusual acetylenic cyclopentenones from the dominant acetylenic fatty acid dicranin presumably also by means of oxylipin pathways. Motivated by the observation that oxylipins often serve as defense metabolites or regulators of defense reactions in higher plants, 7] we explored the chemistry and chemical ecology of oxylipins of D. scoparium. As observed in higher plants and diatoms, the production of volatile oxylipins is triggered by mechanical wounding in mosses as well. Comparing the ultraperformance liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry (UPLC/MS) profiles of methanolic extracts obtained from D. scoparium before and after tissue disruption revealed that a complex mixture of metabolites is produced within seconds after wounding (Figure 1). Owing to the complexity of the chromatograms, we aimed to address the metabolic pathways guided by biosynthetic precursors labeled with stable isotopes. Therefore we prepared monoand dideuterated fatty acids and administered them to the moss (Scheme 1). The acetylenic fatty acid dicranin proved to be of special interest as a precursor of unusual novel oxylipins. After a 10 min administration of monoor dideuterated dicranin suspended in water to frozen powdered moss, a complex mix of deuterated metabolites formed. Since not all oxylipins were chromatographically separated a manual evaluation of UPLC/MS data ran the risk of overlooking relevant signals. We therefore used an automated peak extraction routine that delivers mass/retention time pairs for every compound. These data from nontreated controls and mixtures obtained after treatment with monoor dideuterated dicranin were then evaluated using a canonical analysis of principal coordinates that enabled the rapid identification of dicranin-derived peaks (Figure 1; see the Supporting Information for experimental details). In contrast to the established manual evaluation of UPLC/MS runs this analysis allows an automated quick and comprehensive survey of metabolites derived from labeled precursors. This method covers the entire range of polarities and molecular weights recorded in LC/MS runs and picks up even minor or chromatographically not separated metabolites. The use of two precursors with different degrees of labeling in separate experiments supports the automated evaluation of the chromatogram since the second treatment serves as additional independent replicate (Figure 1c). The use of only one labeled precursor is also feasible, but more care has to be taken in the manual verification of the identified signals to avoid false positive hits. Mass/retention time pairs identified in the canonical analysis were used as guides in the purification of dicranin-derived metabolites using preparative HPLC. Structure elucidation of compounds 2–6 and 8 was based on oneand two-dimensional NMR as well as UV, IR, and MS data. The structure of 7 was tentatively assigned based on derivatization and GC/MS data. Scheme 1.

Both species suffered from overexploitation, but have seen a revival since the 1920s due to increased protection and reintroduction programmes. Increases in the populations and distributions of species that are able to modify ecosystems have generated much scientific interest. Here we review the available literature concerning the possible ecological impact of beaver species in the Old and New World. 2. Beavers, being ecosystem engineers, are among the few species besides humans that can significantly change the geomorphology, and consequently the hydrological characteristics and biotic properties of the landscape. In so doing, beavers increase heterogeneity, and habitat and species diversity at the landscape scale. Beaver foraging also has a considerable impact on the course of ecological succession, species composition and structure of plant commu- nities, making them a good example of ecologically dominant species (e.g. keystone species). 3. Nevertheless, the strength of beavers' impact varies from site to site, depending on the geographical location, relief and the impounded habitat type. Consequently, they may not be significant controlling agents of the ecosystem in all parts of their distribution, but have strong interactions only under certain circumstances. We suggest that beavers can create important management opportunities in the Holarctic, and this review will help land man- agers determine the likely outcome of beaver activity.",0.038183477,0.004621196,0.030758876,0.008074539,0.005012712,0.002460609,0.00214624,0.003252057,0.005800096,0.003318814,0.008478871,0.004950731,0.005695731,0.010500619,0.003936966,0.004114069,0.00198408,0.00352736,0.024063433,0.002958837,0.002337879,0.013169607,0.005896533,0.014576235,0.00317956,0.004213455,0.002891885,0.003029983,0.003516123,[],[],[]

A chitin-induced antifungal ability, based on the production and secretion to the trap liquid of droserone and 5-O-methyldroserone, is described here. Such specific secretion uniquely occurred when chitin injection was used as the eliciting agent and probably reflects a certain kind of defence mechanism that has been evolved for protecting the carnivory-based provision of nutritional precursors. The pitcher liquid containing droserone and 5-O-methyldroserone at 3:1 or 4:1 molar ratio, as well as the purified naphthoquinones, exerted an antifungal effect on a wide range of plant and human fungal pathogens.

Many freeze-tolerant insects accumulate high levels of polyols during autumn cold hardening, whereas freeze-tolerant frogs respond to ice formation in peripheral tissues by synthesizing large amounts of glucose in the liver and rapidly distributing the sugar throughout the body. Seasonal patterns of enzymatic change occur in cold-hardy insects; activities associated with cryoprotectant synthesis rise in the fall, whereas enzymes associated with polyol degradation dominate in the spring. Enzyme profiles also revealed the route of glycerol degradation via polyol dehydrogenase and the novel enzyme, glyceraldehyde kinase. Proton magnetic resonance imaging of freezing and thawing in whole frogs showed a new adaptive effect of the very high glucose levels in core organs; during thawing, organs such as liver and heart melted first, allowing recovery of their vital functions to begin while the rest of the frog thawed. New studies have examined signal transduction in the stimulation of glucose production by wood frog liver, revealing the key role of beta-adrenergic receptors and cAMP-mediated activation of glycogenolysis for cryoprotectant synthesis. The seasonal elevation of plasma membrane glucose transporters was also shown to be key to cryoprotectant distribution during freezing.

Short channel effects, multi-level interconnect cross talk problems, and new materials such as low K dielectric, copper, and silicon on insulator have made modeling and simulation of semiconductor devices and processes extremely difficult. Many times this results in failure to meet performance targets in first silicon introduction. The high cost of mask sets, together with the opportunity costs related to time-to-market, drives the need for shorter and fewer redesign cycles, making effective transistor level design debug a necessity. To make things even more difficult, the transition to flip chip packaging and multiple interconnect metal layers makes backside probing the only effective way to perform node level analysis. This paper describes these new challenges in detail, and the use of photon probing technology as an effective way to address them. The use of a time resolved photon emission microscope allows measuring performance at the critical node level. This is done by collecting the photons, emitted by carriers that are accelerated in the pinch off region during CMOS transistor switching.

The accumulated chemicals are later emitted during courtship display, presumably to lure conspecific females for mating. We analyzed tibial fragrances of males of 15 sympatric Panamanian species in the genus Euglossa to test whether communities of euglossine bees are chemically structured, and to elucidate whether male fragrance signals evolve to convey premating isolation. Our analysis revealed substantial chemical disparity among all lineages. Disparity was mediated by compounds that were exclusive to certain species but also by differences in relative quantity of shared compounds. We mapped tibial fragrance compounds present in each species on a DNA-based phylogeny (reconstructed using partial sequences of COI, EF1-alpha, ArgK, and Pol-II) and found that most dominant compounds were highly homoplasious. In an analysis of chemical differentiation in relation to phylogenetic divergence through time, disparity was greater than expected from a null model at any point during evolutionary history, suggesting that diversifying selection has shaped fragrance phenotypes. Notably, chemical disparity was greater within recently diverged lineages than among them, suggesting that chemical preferences in orchid bees evolved rapidly in the early stages of species divergence. We postulate communication interference as the possible mechanism behind the observed fragrance differentiation, which may be the product of reproductive character (fragrance) displacement.

Ants were trained to forage in an open channel and to memorize the nest entrance relative to four odours that were applied at the corners of an invisible quadratic array. In a test situation, the ants pinpointed the fictive nest only when the odours were present at their learned positions. Our results suggest that the ants had learned the olfactory scenery around their nest. Furthermore, unilaterally antennectomized ants could not pinpoint the nest within a two-dimensional array. Hence, this kind of orientation depends on the simultaneous input of both antennae, that is, on a stereo sense of smell.

In particular, desert-dwelling sidewinder rattlesnakes (Crotalus cerastes) operate effectively on inclined granular media (such as sand dunes) that induce failure in field-tested limbless robots through slipping and pitching. Our laboratory experiments reveal that as granular incline angle increases, sidewinder rattlesnakes increase the length of their body in contact with the sand. Implementing this strategy in a physical robot model of the snake enables the device to ascend sandy slopes close to the angle of maximum slope stability. Plate drag experiments demonstrate that granular yield stresses decrease with increasing incline angle. Together, these three approaches demonstrate how sidewinding with contact-length control mitigates failure on granular media. Robots based on sidewinder rattlesnakes are used to understand motion on sloped granular terrain. [Also see Perspective by Socha] What's that coming over the hill—is it a robot? Crossing a slope can be difficult, particularly if it is made of sand. Sidewinder rattlesnakes manage to climb sandy hills by adjusting the length of their body in contact with the sand. Marvi et al. designed robots based on this idea to determine what affects climbing ability on sandy slopes (see the Perspective by Socha). Based on the behavior of the robots, the authors performed further animal studies, and used an iterative approach to improve the robots' capabilities and to better understand animal motion.

This channel freely permits movement of water across the cell membrane, but it is not permeated by other small, uncharged molecules or charged solutes. AQP1 is a tetramer with each subunit containing an aqueous pore likened to an hourglass formed by obversely arranged tandem repeats. Cryoelectron microscopy of reconstituted AQP1 membrane crystals has revealed the three-dimensional structure at 3-6 A. AQP1 is distributed in apical and basolateral membranes of renal proximal tubules and descending thin limbs as well as capillary endothelia. Ten mammalian aquaporins have been identified in water-permeable tissues and fall into two groupings. Orthodox aquaporins are water-selective and include AQP2, a vasopressin-regulated water channel in renal collecting duct, in addition to AQP0, AQP4, and AQP5. Multifunctional aquaglyceroporins AQP3, AQP7, and AQP9 are permeated by water, glycerol, and some other solutes.

The molecular basis of spore dormancy and resistance is not understood, but the physical state of water in the different spore compartments is thought to play a key role. To characterize this water in situ, we recorded the water 2H and 17O spin relaxation rates in D2O-exchanged Bacillus subtilis spores over a wide frequency range. The data indicate high water mobility throughout the spore, comparable with binary protein–water systems at similar hydration levels. Even in the dense core, the average water rotational correlation time is only 50 ps. Spore dormancy therefore cannot be explained by glass-like quenching of molecular diffusion but may be linked to dehydration-induced conformational changes in key enzymes. The data demonstrate that most spore proteins are rotationally immobilized, which may contribute to heat resistance by preventing heat-denatured proteins from aggregating irreversibly. We also find that the water permeability of the inner membrane is at least 2 orders of magnitude lower than for model membranes, consistent with the reported high degree of lipid immobilization in this membrane and with its proposed role in spore resistance to chemicals that damage DNA. The quantitative results reported here on water mobility and transport provide important clues about the mechanism of spore dormancy and resistance, with relevance to food preservation, disease prevention, and astrobiology.",0.032370258,0.020188762,0.031126253,0.026211692,0.030648818,0.026302276,0.03782695,0.027615568,0.03796968,0.021701898,0.8758116,0.02785876,0.046372473,0.016321545,0.03696465,0.8565111,0.022267377,0.026479464,0.043270335,0.049283516,0.03159987,0.033259496,0.9471721,0.030546341,0.032589376,0.037744403,0.022908883,0.052060623,0.02854753,['fish'],[0.014285714285714],[1.0]

Morphological variations among species and life-cycle stages are accompanied by differences in swimming mode. The goal of this investigation was to compare propulsive jet wakes and swimming performance variables among morphologically distinct salp species (Pegea confoederata, Weelia (Salpa) cylindrica, Cyclosalpa sp.) and relate swimming patterns to ecological function. Using a combination of in situ dye visualization and particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements, we describe properties of the jet wake and swimming performance variables including thrust, drag and propulsive efficiency. Locomotion by all species investigated was achieved via vortex ring propulsion. The slow-swimming P. confoederata produced the highest weight-specific thrust (T=53 N kg–1) and swam with the highest whole-cycle propulsive efficiency (ηwc=55%). The fast-swimming W. cylindrica had the most streamlined body shape but produced an intermediate weight-specific thrust (T=30 N kg–1) and swam with an intermediate whole-cycle propulsive efficiency (ηwc=52%). Weak swimming performance variables in the slow-swimming C. affinis, including the lowest weight-specific thrust (T=25 N kg–1) and lowest whole-cycle propulsive efficiency (ηwc=47%), may be compensated by low energetic requirements.

Decision-making mechanisms related to collective movements—including pre-departure and joining—have already been studied at different steps of the movement process, but these studies were always carried out separately. We therefore have no understanding of how these different processes are related when they underlie the same collective decision-making event. Here, we consider the whole departure process of two groups of Tonkean macaques (Macaca tonkeana), using a stochastic model. When several exclusive choices are proposed, macaques vote and choose the majority. Individuals then join the movement according to a mimetism based on affiliative relationships. The pre-departure quorum and the joining mimetic mechanism are probably linked, but we have not yet identified which transition mechanism is used. This study shows that decision-making related to macaque group movements is governed by a quorum rule combined with a selective mimetism at departure. This is the first time that transition mechanisms have been described in mammals, which consequently helps understand how a voting process leads to social amplification. Our study also provides the first complete proof that there is continuity in the decision-making processes underlying collective movements in mammals from the first intention movement right through to the last joiner.",0.012826719,0.007334792,0.015786458,0.022211583,0.008688373,0.006994317,0.005632631,0.006071269,0.007799569,0.015338708,0.00924855,0.012004732,0.012772565,0.015401382,0.006148532,0.007237583,0.027546866,0.008124428,0.023481922,0.006429312,0.004529853,0.66690135,0.010960295,0.012299993,0.00711325,0.030165674,0.005162348,0.003862516,0.005835245,"['bacteria', 'bombina maxima', 'bombina']","[0.023809523809523003, 0.023809523809523003, 0.023809523809523003]","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0]"

This finding suggested that the application of repellent could be used as part of filth fly management. Further evaluations of catnip oil toxicity were conducted to provide a broad‐spectrum safety profile of catnip oil use as a potential biting and nuisance insect repellent in urban settings. Acute oral, dermal, inhalation, primary dermal and eye irritation toxicity tests were performed. The acute oral LD50 of catnip oil was found to be 3160 mg/kg body weight (BW) and 2710 mg/kg BW in female and male rats, respectively. The acute dermal LD50 was > 5000 mg/kg BW. The acute inhalation LD50 was observed to be > 10 000 mg/m3. Primary skin irritation tested on New Zealand white rabbits showed that catnip oil is a moderate irritant. Catnip oil was classified as practically non‐irritating to the eye.

We explored the defence potential of the frustules as armour against predators by measuring their strength. Real and virtual loading tests (using calibrated glass microneedles and finite element analysis) were performed on centric and pennate diatom cells. Here we show that the frustules are remarkably strong by virtue of their architecture and the material properties of the diatom silica.

The epidermal-growth-control theory, postulated in 1867 and verified in 2007, states that epidermal cells determine the rate of organ elongation since they are under tension, while inner tissues are under compression. The lipid cuticle layer is deposited on the surface of outer epidermal cell walls and modifies the chemical and mechanical nature of these cell walls. Thus, the plant cuticle plays a key role in plant interaction with the environment and in controlling organ expansion. Rheological analyses indicate that the cuticle is a mostly viscoelastic and strain-hardening material that stiffens the comparatively more elastic epidermal cell walls. Cuticle stiffness can be attributed to polysaccharides and flavonoids present in the cuticle whereas a cutin matrix is mainly responsible for its extensibility. Environmental conditions such as temperature and relative humidity have a plasticizing effect on the mechanical properties of cuticle since they lower cuticle stiffness and strength. The external appearance of agricultural commodities, especially fruits, is of great economic value.

The temperature in this region of the prothorax is higher by 6-9 degrees C than that at the tip of the abdomen, and this in actively flying hornets outside the nest (workers, males or queens) as well as in hornets inside the nest that attend to the brood in the combs. On viewing the region from the outside, one discerns a canal or rather a fissure in the cuticle, which commences at the center of the dorsal surface of the prothorax and extends till the mesothorax. Thus the length of this canal or fissure is approximately 5-7 mm and it is seen to contain numerous thin hairs whose shape varies from that of the hairs alongside the structure. Beneath the cuticle in this region there are dorsoventral as well as longitudinal muscles in abundance, much the same as the musculature in the remaining thoracic segments (i.e. the meso- and metathorax), which activate the two pairs of wings. The canal-bearing segment is of course devoid of wings, and its dorsoventral muscles are attached to the cuticle, which in this region resembles a bowl harboring several layers of epithelium that boasts numerous butterfly-shaped tracheal branches. Additionally there are layers that display lymph-filled spaces and also perforated layers and depressions, and beneath all these is a lace-like layer that also coats the cuticle's hollows. Underneath the cuticle proper, there are numerous large mitochondria and tracheae, which occupy a considerable part of the cuticular epithelium surface. These abundant mitochondria are, most probably, the main element of heat production in the thermogenic center.",0.009039929,0.013007805,0.00854152,0.004615461,0.010660499,0.010660344,0.00887953,0.006284298,0.009392932,0.007590215,0.01177766,0.005459549,0.007871533,0.005034069,0.004210613,0.015185325,0.006196736,0.00778287,0.00599917,0.007746951,0.010679234,0.005816247,0.94693583,0.004085741,0.008331755,0.008195646,0.006521276,0.011571864,0.013113573,"['bacteria', 'argentina']","[0.030303030303030002, 0.030303030303030002]","[1.0, 1.0]"

Sphincterochila boissieri (Charpentier, 1847) is a fairly small snail (average weight about 4 g) with a chalky-white shell. Animals used for laboratory studies were collected in the central Negev near Avdat and Sde Bokher and shipped by air to Duke University. Summer field studies were carried out in the same area, where the mean annual rainfall is less than 100 mm. The rains are concentrated in the winter months, from November to March, and during this period the snails are active, feed, and reproduce. During the remainder of the year the snails presumably remain dormant. Three types of mineral surface material are common in this area: (a) a. firmly packed powdery soil or loess, (b) limestone rocks and pebbles with a granular, disintegrating surface, and (c) broken-up black flint. While Sphincterochila is common in the loesslimestone areas, it is much less common on the flint substratum. Sphincterochila is a mud-eater; that is, after rain it comes out and eats large quantities of the surface material (loess); and, in our experience, also material from the surface of limestone rocks and pebbles. The digestible material contained in this predominantly mineral diet is primarily algae and lichens. Sphincterochila shows no obvious interest in those higher plants which are eaten by other snails in the same area, such as Eremina and Helicella.

Soil N uptake by moss species may allow them to compete for soil N in a wide range of ecosystems. Moreover, since many terrestrial ecosystems are N limited, soil N uptake by mosses may have implications for plant community structure and nutrient cycling.

PREMISE OF THE STUDY
We investigated how the ""living rock"" cactus Ariocarpus fissuratus, like other low-growing desert plants, can endure potentially lethal high temperatures at the soil surface. Specifically, we examined how shoot descent by root contraction in the presence or absence of soil rocks influences shoot temperatures and transpiration. •


METHODS
Root contraction was identified by measuring shoot descent and anatomical analysis. Temperatures and transpiration were measured for plants at two heights in sandy and rocky soil, and temperature tolerances were determined by vital staining. •


KEY RESULTS
Plants embedded in rocky soil survived an extreme heat episode, unlike plants in sandy soil, though rocks did not moderate low temperatures. Root contraction occurred regardless of season and soil moisture. Xylem conduits (wide-band tracheids) formed a compressible lattice that decreased root length as rays enlarged the root base radially. Plant position in the soil did not affect transpiration. •


CONCLUSIONS
Contractile roots pulled plants of A. fissuratus into the soil at rates of 6-30 mm yr(-1). Maintaining shoots level with the soil surface kept plant temperatures below the high lethal temperature and improved survivorship in soil shaded by surface rocks.",0.015540387,0.004419264,0.010804629,0.002853024,0.019763546,0.004005426,0.032613266,0.006583797,0.023739375,0.006291723,0.018331874,0.013601624,0.009548656,0.008178877,0.015140218,0.8929588,0.00679643,0.009593265,0.01674264,0.009659355,0.005813237,0.00801177,0.045597862,0.014120881,0.01141448,0.022300081,0.006948393,0.040664334,0.012560188,"['salticidae', 'culicivora', 'spiders']","[0.015873015873015, 0.047619047619047006, 0.015873015873015]","[0.33333333333333304, 1.0, 0.33333333333333304]"

DNF is a membrane-bound E3 ligase that represses CO expression and plays an important role in maintaining low levels of CO expression in short days; it is thus essential for the ability of the Arabidopsis plant to have a different flowering response in long and short days. The photoperiodic response in Arabidopsis thaliana requires the precise regulation of CONSTANS (CO) expression in relation to the light period during the day. In short days (SDs) levels of CO expression are normally low during the light period, and this results in delayed flowering compared with long days (LDs) when CO expression rises to high levels before the end of the light period. We identified a novel flowering time gene called DAY NEUTRAL FLOWERING (DNF) that acts in the same flowering pathway as CO. DNF is a membrane-bound E3 ligase that represses CO expression and plays an important role in maintaining low levels of CO expression in SDs. The effect of DNF on the rhythm of CO expression is essential for the photoperiodic response of Arabidopsis, enabling it to have a different flowering response in LDs and SDs.",0.05775635,0.79016006,0.023390865,0.84875077,0.023246758,0.031926896,0.027486676,0.03836819,0.014092888,0.03361308,0.017956866,0.04222259,0.039517816,0.83291966,0.033173468,0.012858626,0.041964814,0.034850232,0.046859447,0.020108968,0.025450142,0.06082024,0.05658703,0.020636888,0.03572303,0.032843854,0.027991027,0.043071367,0.040888865,"['insects', 'temnothorax albipennis']","[0.017857142857142003, 0.017857142857142003]","[1.0, 1.0]"

Most Phocidae have vibrissae with undulated surfaces, while Otariidae, Odobenidae, and a few phocid species possess vibrissae with smooth surfaces. Variations in cross-sectional profile and orientation of the vibrissae also exist between pinniped species. These factors may influence the way that the vibrissae behave when exposed to water flow. This study investigated the effect that vibrissal surface structure and orientation have on flow-induced vibrations of pinniped vibrissae. Laser vibrometry was used to record vibrations along the whisker shaft from the undulated vibrissae of harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) and northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) and the smooth vibrissae of California sea lions (Zalophus californianus). Vibrations along the whisker shaft were measured in a flume tank, at three orientations (0°, 45°, 90°) to the water flow. The results show that vibration frequency and velocity ranges were similar for both undulated and smooth vibrissae. Angle of orientation, rather than surface structure, had the greatest effect on flow-induced vibrations. Vibration velocity was up to 60 times higher when the wide, flat aspect of the whisker faced into the flow (90°), compared to when the thin edge faced into the flow (0°). Vibration frequency was also dependent on angle of orientation. Peak frequencies were measured up to 270 Hz and were highest at the 0° orientation for all whiskers.

The results suggest that lift enhancement during clap-and-fling requires an angular separation between the two wings of no more than 10–12°. Within the limitations of the robotic apparatus, the clap-and-fling augmented total lift production by up to 17%, but depended strongly on stroke kinematics. The time course of the interaction between the wings was quite complex. For example, wing interaction attenuated total force during the initial part of the wing clap, but slightly enhanced force at the end of the clap phase. We measured two temporally transient peaks of both lift and drag enhancement during the fling phase: a prominent peak during the initial phase of the fling motion, which accounts for most of the benefit in lift production, and a smaller peak of force enhancement at the end fling when the wings started to move apart. A detailed digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) analysis during clap-and-fling showed that the most obvious effect of the bilateral `image' wing on flow occurs during the early phase of the fling, due to a strong fluid influx between the wings as they separate. The DPIV analysis revealed, moreover, that circulation induced by a leading edge vortex (LEV) during the early fling phase was smaller than predicted by inviscid two-dimensional analytical models, whereas circulation of LEV nearly matched the predictions of Weis-Fogh's inviscid model at late fling phase. In addition, the presence of the image wing presumably causes subtle modifications in both the wake capture and viscous forces. Collectively, these effects explain some of the changes in total force and lift production during the fling. Quite surprisingly, the effect of clap-and-fling is not restricted to the dorsal part of the stroke cycle but extends to the beginning of upstroke, suggesting that the presence of the image wing distorts the gross wake structure throughout the stroke cycle.",0.011462938,0.01273832,0.015177784,0.010872801,0.021449547,0.024454461,0.016435198,0.00770919,0.01338759,0.009740707,0.0056334,0.008648012,0.014030904,0.022563258,0.009429473,0.005966098,0.8756277,0.012440154,0.012739387,0.023221727,0.021371027,0.019532064,0.021499818,0.011460793,0.010361431,0.01065017,0.008952471,0.007354277,0.017315488,[],[],[]

While the biochemical composition of the slime is known, its unusual nature and the mechanism of ensnaring thread formation have remained elusive. We have examined gene expression in the slime gland from an Australian onychophoran, Euperipatoides rowelli, and matched expressed sequence tags to separated proteins from the slime. The analysis revealed three categories of protein present: unique high-molecular-weight proline-rich proteins, and smaller concentrations of lectins and small peptides, the latter two likely to act as protease inhibitors and antimicrobial agents. The predominant proline-rich proteins (200 kDa+) are composed of tandem repeated motifs and distinguished by an unusually high proline and charged residue content. Unlike the highly structured proteins such as silks used for prey capture by spiders and insects, these proteins lack ordered secondary structure over their entire length. We propose that on expulsion of slime from the gland onto prey, evaporative water loss triggers a glass transition change in the protein solution, resulting in adhesive and enmeshing thread formation, assisted by cross-linking of complementary charged and hydrophobic regions of the protein. Euperipatoides rowelli has developed an entirely new method of capturing prey by harnessing disordered proteins rather than structured, silk-like proteins.",0.028804878,0.011928542,0.05262138,0.02084284,0.01635254,0.029001724,0.01057397,0.042954985,0.02177947,0.9035702,0.023696983,0.07018323,0.009502636,0.020972835,0.12051121,0.02068159,0.012806141,0.016219953,0.019142838,0.032912638,0.007333816,0.02538977,0.012482134,0.81222713,0.03322932,0.013870025,0.01036349,0.02155581,0.026922984,[],[],[]

Our approach was to numerically simulate flow through networks of pipes with randomly prescribed radii. The permeability k and inverse formation factor 1/F were calculated in a large number of network realizations of varying size and degree of heterogeneity (i.e., the width of the pipe radius distribution). We generally observed a large decrease of the ensemble arithmetic averages of k and 1/F with increasing network size (i.e., negative scale effect). Conversely, the ensemble geometric averages showed a moderate positive scale effect in three-dimensional simple cubic networks. We also found that in networks smaller than 32 × 32 or 10 × 10 × 10, the ensemble standard deviations of k and 1/F had a power law dependence on network size (defined as the total number of pipes) with an exponent α varying from −0.5 in homogeneous networks to large negative values depending on lattice topology in highly heterogeneous ones (−α increased with increasing lattice connectiveness, i.e., with coordination number). Thus at small scales the network transport properties were characterized by a nonuniversal power law scaling. At larger scales we observed a transition to a presumably “universal” power law scaling with an exponent equal to −0.5 independently on the degree of heterogeneity, dimensionality and lattice topology. Comparing our results to published experimental data, we found a good agreement, except in cases where we suspect that the small-scale measurements suffered a significant bias (indicated by non-nested distributions at increasing scales). We speculate that the strong positive scale effect generally observed in nature is also caused by sampling bias at small scales.",0.92409486,0.018476654,0.80542177,0.02439746,0.023045907,0.023472738,0.014155781,0.015074215,0.021306839,0.02687988,0.021153426,0.018205198,0.023059877,0.023891427,0.015941115,0.013833848,0.016857443,0.013400489,0.02875134,0.025590861,0.016621618,0.017425494,0.021964965,0.036463298,0.0212824,0.010036475,0.008125047,0.01905766,0.03131428,"['lepidoptera', 'phyllonorycter', 'insects', 'phyllonorycter blancardella', 'bacteria']","[0.02, 0.02, 0.02, 0.02, 0.02]","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]"

Kinetic and potential energy, lost at one stage of a stride, is stored temporarily as elastic strain energy and returned later in an elastic recoil. At high speeds, men and kangaroos seem to save in this way more than half the metabolic energy they would otherwise need for locomotion.

It is shown by means of a generalized model that muscles and tendons could both be important as elastic energy stores. Analysis of films and force records of kangaroos hopping shows that strain energy stored while the feet are on the ground must be stored mainly distal to the knee. The principal muscles there have short fibres, and most of the storage must be in tendons. Investigation of camels shows that tendons in the feet, distal to the ankle and wrist, are especially important. The scope for elastic storage while the feet are off the groundis also considered.

The most important characteristic of the genusLabyrinthula is a colourless branched plasmatic network of pseudopodia-like tubes with sliding spindle-shaped uninuclear plasma portions (cell bodies). After fluorescent staining tubulin appears to be uniformly and diffusely distributed throughout the whole network and to form a reticulate structure in the cell bodies. The inhibitor colchicine has no influence on the sliding motility of the cell bodies nor on the movement of the network. Actin is frequently found in the network, partly in the form of microfilament bundles, which are longitudinally arranged. Actin is also present in the cortical region of cell bodies, or of cell body groups. It was difficult to distinguish single cell bodies within groups by fluorescence. The inhibitors cytochalasin B and D stop the movement of cell bodies and network. Myosin is present in the cortical region of each cell body, and the central portions of each individual cell body contain accumulations of this protein. We could not observe any fluorescence in the network after myosin staining with the antibodies we used. An actin-myosin complex is probably responsible for the sliding movement of cell bodies in the Labyrinthula network, because actin is found in the pseudopodia-like tubes, and the cortex of the cell bodies is rich in actin and myosin. This actin-myosin complex seems to differ from another actin-myosin complex that has been postulated to be responsible for the locomotion of pseudopodia-like tubes. We propose that two actin-myosin complexes exist. One of them is responsible for locomotory phenomena of the network, and the second for cell body sliding in the pseudopodia-like tubes. In each case the myosin is probably anchored in the inner matrix membrane of the pseudopodia-like tubes.

However when in close proximity to neighboring turbines, HAWTs suffer from a reduced power coefficient. In contrast, previous research on vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs) suggests that closely spaced VAWTs may experience only small decreases (or even increases) in an individual turbine's power coefficient when placed in close proximity to neighbors, thus yielding much higher power outputs for a given area of land. A potential flow model of inter-VAWT interactions is developed to investigate the effect of changes in VAWT spatial arrangement on the array performance coefficient, which compares the expected average power coefficient of turbines in an array to a spatially isolated turbine. A geometric arrangement based on the configuration of shed vortices in the wake of schooling fish is shown to significantly increase the array performance coefficient based upon an array of 16 x 16 wind turbines.

The high sensitivity of this sensory system should allow a seal to gain hydrodynamic information resulting from movements of other aquatic animals, such as prey, predators or conspecifics.",0.044247746,0.01777313,0.01700148,0.0186545,0.01399428,0.88878715,0.009446065,0.006437377,0.035222866,0.015710779,0.014150072,0.007138925,0.012109583,0.014044314,0.006759777,0.00544265,0.07137196,0.010087225,0.005776671,0.18462251,0.007952848,0.021917878,0.041231375,0.015105595,0.011124824,0.010279793,0.010069523,0.006696583,0.014304997,['bacteria'],[0.010101010101010001],[1.0]

At 20 degrees C, ureteral urine was also collected from bladderless turtles and was analyzed for pH, ions, NH3+, total CO2, osmolality, and titratable acid. When CO2 was breathed there was a compensatory change in the strong-ion difference as manifest by an increase in plasma [HCO3-] that was approximately 10 meq/l both in the 10 and 20 degrees C turtles. The only significant associated strong-ion changes observed consistent with the ionic compensatory response were increases in total and ionized Ca2+ and total Mg2+. These results were unaffected at either temperature by surgical removal of the urinary bladder. Urine collected from cystectomized turtles showed no compensatory increase in acid excretion during hypercapnia; in fact, changes occurred in the opposite direction. Urinary excretion of HCO3- and urine pH increased significantly, whereas titratable acidity decreased significantly.

Over a decade after the description of this organism our knowledge about the structures and strategies underlying its remarkable thermal resistance remains incipient. The accumulation of a restricted number of charged organic solutes is a common response to heat stress in hyperthermophilic organisms and accordingly their role in thermoprotection has been often postulated. In this work, the organic solute pool of P. fumarii was characterized using 1H, 13C, and 31P NMR. Di-myo-inositol phosphate was the major solute (0.21 μmol/mg protein), reinforcing the correlation between the occurrence of this solute and hyperthermophily; in addition, UDP-sugars (total concentration 0.11 μmol/mg protein) were present. The structures of the two major UDP-sugars were identified as UDP-α-GlcNAc3NAc and UDP-α-GlcNAc3NAc-(4 ← 1)-β-GlcpNAc3NAc. Interestingly, the latter compound appears to be derived from the first one by addition of a 2,3-N-acetylglucoronic acid unit, suggesting that these UDP-sugars are intermediates of an N-linked glycosylation pathway.

Termites are known to engage in a mutualism with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, and Pinto-Tomás et al. (p. 1120) have identified similar relationships occurring among leaf-cutter ants, which maintain specialized nitrogen-fixing bacteria in their fungus gardens. Together, these mutualisms are a major source of nitrogen in terrestrial ecosystems. How is the evolutionary stability of such mutualistic cooperation maintained? Aanen et al. (p. 1103) show that the Termitomyces fungus cultured by termites remains highly related because mycelia of the same clone fuse together and grow more efficiently to out-compete rare clones. Leaf-cutting ants engage in a mutualism with nitrogen-fixing bacteria that help fertilize their fungus gardens. Bacteria-mediated acquisition of atmospheric N2 serves as a critical source of nitrogen in terrestrial ecosystems. Here we reveal that symbiotic nitrogen fixation facilitates the cultivation of specialized fungal crops by leaf-cutter ants. By using acetylene reduction and stable isotope experiments, we demonstrated that N2 fixation occurred in the fungus gardens of eight leaf-cutter ant species and, further, that this fixed nitrogen was incorporated into ant biomass. Symbiotic N2-fixing bacteria were consistently isolated from the fungus gardens of 80 leaf-cutter ant colonies collected in Argentina, Costa Rica, and Panama.

In bumblebees, the mechanical response of filiform hairs in the presence of electric fields provides key evidence for electrosensitivity to ecologically relevant electric fields. Mechanosensory hairs in arthropods have been shown to function as fluid flow or sound particle velocity receivers. The present work provides direct evidence for additional, nonexclusive functionality involving electrical Coulomb-force coupling between distant charged objects and mechanosensory hairs. Thus, the sensory mechanism is proposed to rely on electromechanical coupling, whereby many light thin hairs serve the detection of the electrical field surrounding a bumblebee approaching a flower. This finding prompts the possibility that other terrestrial animals use such sensory hairs to detect and respond to electric fields. Bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) use information from surrounding electric fields to make foraging decisions. Electroreception in air, a nonconductive medium, is a recently discovered sensory capacity of insects, yet the sensory mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we investigate two putative electric field sensors: antennae and mechanosensory hairs. Examining their mechanical and neural response, we show that electric fields cause deflections in both antennae and hairs. Hairs respond with a greater median velocity, displacement, and angular displacement than antennae. Extracellular recordings from the antennae do not show any electrophysiological correlates to these mechanical deflections. In contrast, hair deflections in response to an electric field elicited neural activity. Mechanical deflections of both hairs and antennae increase with the electric charge carried by the bumblebee. From this evidence, we conclude that sensory hairs are a site of electroreception in the bumblebee.",0.016379861,0.11916535,0.017417267,0.05352886,0.003434205,0.011476189,0.004723541,0.006806429,0.008376911,0.010919479,0.005249142,0.009931776,0.00669606,0.010229964,0.003219631,0.005980109,0.008906479,0.00785603,0.006099903,0.007849911,0.003203126,0.40486208,0.021051172,0.006208237,0.005503482,0.008561479,0.004549508,0.004137992,0.008933183,['euplectella aspergillum'],[0.015151515151515001],[1.0]

However, it is known that frictional properties of the ventral surface of the snake skin range in a very broad range and the degree of anisotropy ranges as well to a quite strong extent. This might be due to the variety of species studied, diversity of approaches used for the friction characterization, and/or due to the variety of substrates used as a counterpart in the experiments. In order to understand the interactions between the nanostructure arrays of the ventral surface of the snake skin, this study was undertaken, which is aimed at numerical modeling of frictional properties of the structurally anisotropic surfaces in contact with various size of asperities. The model shows that frictional anisotropy appears on the snake skin only on the substrates with a characteristic range of roughness, which is less or comparable with dimensions of the skin microstructure. In other words, scale of the skin relief should reflect an adaptation to the particular range of surfaces asperities of the substrate.",0.015569616,0.010799916,0.013429885,0.006608327,0.006803677,0.01123329,0.010261529,0.00818609,0.010202653,0.016717875,0.004061991,0.008518167,0.008868781,0.01021695,0.006983532,0.014925477,0.012530245,0.005536743,0.004620908,0.016518252,0.012843389,0.007190111,0.018250778,0.010154342,0.007636907,0.009062031,0.010088054,0.009721211,0.89577264,"['echinodermata', 'asteroidea', 'pisaster giganteus']","[0.018181818181818, 0.018181818181818, 0.018181818181818]","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0]"

Pristid sawfish occur circumtropically and can reach maximum total lengths of around 700 cm. All pristid species are globally endangered due to their restricted habitat inshore. Pristiophorid sawsharks are small sharks of maximum total lengths below 150 cm, which occur in depths of 70–900 m. Close examination of the morphology of pectoral fin basals and the internal structure of the rostrum reveals that sclerorhynchids and pristids evolved independently from rhinobatids, whereas pristiophorids are squalomorph sharks.

Experiments show that this spider can identify its preferred prey by sight alone and by odor alone. When presented with two types of size-matched motionless lures, E. culicivora consistently chose blood-fed female mosquitoes in preference to nonmosquito prey, male mosquitoes, and sugar-fed female mosquitoes (i.e., females that had not been feeding on blood). When the choice was between mosquitoes of different sizes (both blood- or both sugar-fed), small juveniles chose the smaller prey, whereas adults and larger juveniles chose the larger prey. However, preference for blood took precedence over preference for size (i.e., to get a blood meal, small individuals took prey that were larger than the preferred size, and larger individuals took prey that were smaller than the preferred size).

As such, it can be used as a model system for analyzing the molecular mechanisms of water permeability. We investigated AQP dynamics and water permeability in the pelvic skin of H. japonica following challenge with AVT, hydrins (intermediate peptides of pro-AVT) and β-adrenergic effectors. In the in vivo experiment, both AQP-h2 and AQP-h3 proteins were translocated to the apical plasma membrane in the principal cells of the first-reacting cell (FRC) layer in the pelvic skin following challenge with AVT, hydrin 1 and hydrin 2, thereby increasing the water permeability of the pelvic skin. The β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol (IP) and its anatagonist propranolol (PP) in combination with AVT or hydrins were used as challenge in the in vitro experiment. IP increased water permeability whereas PP inhibited it, and both events were well correlated with the translocation of the AQPs to the apical membrane. In the PP+AVT-treated skins, labels for AQP-h2 and AQP-h3 were differentially visible among the principal cells; the apical plasma membrane of some cells was labeled while others were not, indicating that the response of PP or AVT is different from cell to cell. These results provide morphological evidence that the principal cells of the FRC layers may have two kinds of receptors: a V2 receptor and β-adrenergic receptor.",0.945862,0.010762969,0.020772493,0.052262757,0.00567627,0.012806207,0.006460067,0.004571267,0.005030822,0.011067488,0.019885689,0.013518699,0.009619,0.021610634,0.006840735,0.012014956,0.006433108,0.013371971,0.023149533,0.021278923,0.009868098,0.013120764,0.014452519,0.00800265,0.008148445,0.008727033,0.006093841,0.011237963,0.011840176,"['cellana tramoserica', 'limpets']","[0.016393442622950002, 0.065573770491803]","[0.25, 1.0]"

Our results suggest for the first time that history influences wall building in ants when worker density decreases (e.g. with colony diminution) as well as when it increases (e.g. with colony growth) as shown by earlier work. Furthermore, we found that ants used a greater number of the larger building blocks (big sand grains) both after cavity expansion and, more surprisingly, also after cavity contraction.

A model for the vortex dynamics associated with this phenomenon is developed, showing that the energy extraction mechanism can be described by simple criteria governing the kinematics of the vortices relative to the body in the flow. In this way, we need not make direct appeal to the fluid dynamics, which can be more difficult to evaluate than the kinematics. Examples of these principles as exhibited in swimming fish and existing energy conversion devices are described. A benefit of the developed framework is that the potentially infinite-dimensional parameter space of the fluid-structure interaction is reduced to a maximum of eight combinations of three parameters.

Sophisticated friction modifying nanostructures are described. These include an ordered microfibrillar array that can function to achieve mission adaptable friction characteristics. Significant reduction of adhesive forces in the contact areas caused by the 'double-ridge' nanoscale microfibrillar geometry provides ideal conditions for sliding in forward direction with minimum adhesive forces and friction. Low surface adhesion in these local contact points may reduce local wear and skin contamination by environmental debris. The highly asymmetric, 'pawl-like' profile of the microfibrillar ends with radius of curvature 20-40 nm induces friction anisotropy in forward backward motions and serves as an effective stopper for backward motion preserving low friction for forward motion. The system of continuous micropores penetrating through the snake skin may serve as a delivery system for lubrication/anti-adhesive lipid mixture that provides for boundary lubrication of snake skins.",0.01286783,0.009057125,0.013800926,0.005214043,0.008996955,0.014147984,0.009673277,0.008278791,0.009142066,0.015767835,0.003800506,0.008256158,0.008118129,0.008472864,0.00568232,0.012586294,0.013397909,0.005101926,0.004166019,0.015177312,0.01610085,0.006536682,0.018495891,0.01074781,0.008398784,0.009379135,0.009968298,0.009307951,0.8978394,"['bacteria', 'bird']","[0.02127659574468, 0.02127659574468]","[1.0, 1.0]"

CAO is based on the use of the Finite-Element-Method (FEM). The present paper shows how 15 years after the CAO-method drastic simplifications are available.

We show that the phytophagous leaf-mining moth Phyllonorycter blancardella (Lepidoptera) relies on bacterial endosymbionts, most likely Wolbachia, to manipulate the physiology of its host plant resulting in the ‘green-island’ phenotype—photosynthetically active green patches in otherwise senescent leaves—and to increase its fitness.

1 
Rapid movements in fungi and plants have evolved in different species to facilitate the dispersal of spores and seeds. The mechanisms of action can differ among species, but the effectiveness of these movements has rarely, if ever, been tested. Here we show through a quantitative biomechanical analysis that the stamens of Cornus canadensis L. (bunchberry) are ideal for catapulting pollen vertically at high speeds. 
 
2 
We develop a biomechanical model to describe the explosive launch of pollen from the flowers of bunchberry. The model determines the equation of motion for the stamens based only on the morphology and measurements of the parts of the stamens. To measure the motion of the stamens to compare with our model, we analysed individual frames of a video taken at 10 000 fps. 
 
3 
The thecae of adjacent stamens dehisce in bud so that the stomia face each other, retaining pollen between neighbouring anthers. As the flowers open, pollen is accelerated vertically as long as the thecae remain in contact. Pollen is released only when the anthers move horizontally and separate. 
 
4 
The observed motion of the stamens matches the results from our model through release of the pollen. The model reveals that pollen release (horizontal movement of the anthers) occurs only after the vertical speed is at its maximum. Thus, for this particular catapult mechanism, the morphology of the stamens is optimal for launching light, dry pollen straight upwards at high speed. Pollen launched vertically at high speed both enhances insect pollination by helping to making pollen stick on visiting insects, and also allows for successful wind pollination by propelling pollen into the air column. Seed set by inflorescences in pollinator-exclosure cages further supports the ability of this flower to use wind as a pollination mechanism.",0.033051573,0.004186589,0.007486134,0.003639746,0.005897562,0.005679503,0.004566506,0.007996202,0.02960346,0.012592086,0.004039955,0.10896374,0.00373544,0.023036802,0.007924949,0.026809754,0.01064234,0.006009312,0.21664836,0.005468235,0.006926521,0.009370956,0.007492784,0.011494997,0.003148192,0.00548606,0.004802969,0.009414719,0.013376736,"['bears', 'dog', 'mammals', 'mouse', 'mice']","[0.021739130434782, 0.021739130434782, 0.043478260869565, 0.021739130434782, 0.021739130434782]","[0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5]"

Aggrecan was chemically end-attached onto gold-coated planar silicon substrates and gold-coated microspherical atomic force microscope probe tips (end radius R approximately 2.5 mum) at a density ( approximately 40 mg/mL) that simulates physiological conditions in the tissue ( approximately 20-80 mg/mL). Colloidal force spectroscopy was employed to measure the adhesion between opposing aggrecan monolayers in NaCl (0.001-1.0 M) and NaCl + CaCl(2) ([Cl(-)] = 0.15 M, [Ca(2+)] = 0 - 75 mM) aqueous electrolyte solutions. Aggrecan self-adhesion was found to increase with increasing surface equilibration time upon compression (0-30 s). Hydrogen bonding and physical entanglements between the chondroitin sulfate-glycosaminoglycan side chains are proposed as important factors contributing to aggrecan self-adhesion. Self-adhesion was found to significantly increase with decreasing bath ionic strength (and hence, electrostatic double-layer repulsion), as well as increasing Ca(2+) concentration due to the additional ion-bridging effects. It is hypothesized that aggrecan self-adhesion, and the macromolecular energy dissipation that results from this self-adhesion, could be important factors contributing to the self-assembled architecture and integrity of the cartilage extracellular matrix in vivo.",0.008463575,0.004291793,0.009723221,0.002936335,0.9033448,0.006137118,0.025372691,0.018474236,0.011743871,0.013035297,0.007485167,0.004309746,0.005024794,0.004662991,0.009460139,0.009904323,0.006461971,0.006303806,0.008206898,0.004546032,0.018008346,0.004140823,0.008755385,0.006806497,0.020175857,0.01135082,0.018172001,0.00584912,0.007137178,[],[],[]

To survive this process, pollen grains possess a variety of physiological and structural adaptations. Perhaps the most striking of these adaptations is the ability of the pollen wall to fold onto itself to prevent further desiccation. Roger P. Wodehouse coined the term harmomegathy for this folding process in recognition of the critical role it plays in the survival of the pollen grain. There is still, however, no quantitative theory that explains how the structure of the pollen wall contributes to harmomegathy. Here we demonstrate that simple geometrical and mechanical principles explain how wall structure guides pollen grains toward distinct folding pathways. We found that the presence of axially elongated apertures of high compliance is critical for achieving a predictable and reversible folding pattern. Moreover, the intricate sculpturing of the wall assists pollen closure by preventing mirror buckling of the surface. These results constitute quantitative structure-function relationships for pollen harmomegathy and provide a framework to elucidate the functional significance of the very diverse pollen morphologies observed in angiosperms.",0.010174089,0.008169518,0.04081184,0.004513189,0.03622843,0.018214345,0.030003466,0.014414174,0.8831707,0.010709948,0.020327937,0.04553074,0.010903202,0.007755449,0.026063524,0.735367,0.010133271,0.019662272,0.018355047,0.035309516,0.010819878,0.016412506,0.04025318,0.03188085,0.007761925,0.032354973,0.009140106,0.04143235,0.021729326,"['beetles', 'bark beetles', 'dwarf', 'spruce budworm']","[0.009615384615384, 0.009615384615384, 0.009615384615384, 0.009615384615384]","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]"

It is impossible to prevent penetration of microorganisms in oil and fuels both stored in tanks or in oilfields after drilling. Both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms tend to colonise oil pipelines and oil and fuel storage installations. Complex microbial communities consisting of both hydrocarbon oxidizing microorganisms and bacteria using the metabolites of the former form an ecological niche where they thrive. The accumulation of water at the bottom of storage tanks and in oil pipelines is a primary prerequisite for development of microorganisms in fuels and oil and their subsequent biological fouling. Ability of microorganisms to grow both in a water phase and on inter-phase of water/hydrocarbon as well as the generation of products of their metabolism worsen the physical and chemical properties of oils and fuels. This activity also increases the amount of suspended solids, leads to the formation of slimes and creates a variety of operational problems.

The responses of the pupil of a nocturnal gecko (Gekko gekko) to external light stimulus were studied. 2. The responses of the pupil are determined by light entering the pupil and not by light acting directly on the iris. 3. The responses of the pupil are very uniform in sensitivity including spectral sensitivity for light coming in different directions to the eye. 4. The possible change in area of the pupil is more than 300-fold and probably represents an effort to shield the pure rod retina from saturating light intensities. 5. The pupil continues to contract sharply for changes in external light intensity which give retinal illuminations corresponding to 106 quanta/sec. striking a retinal rod. 6. There is a large degree of spatial summation of the response; circular external light fields subtending 5 and 140° giving the same illumination at the pupil give approximately the same pupil response. 7. The spectral sensitivity curve agrees with the absorption curve of an extracted pigment from a closely related gecko described by Crescitelli in the followig paper. It is similar to the human scotopic curve but its maximum is displaced about 20 to 30 mµ towards the red end of the spectrum.

Here we use global and targeted proteomic analyses on a key unicellular marine diazotroph Crocosphaera watsonii to reveal large scale diel changes in its proteome, including substantial variations in concentrations of iron metalloproteins involved in nitrogen fixation and photosynthesis, as well as nocturnal flavodoxin production. The daily synthesis and degradation of enzymes in coordination with their utilization results in a lowered cellular metalloenzyme inventory that requires ∼40% less iron than if these enzymes were maintained throughout the diel cycle. This strategy is energetically expensive, but appears to serve as an important adaptation for confronting the iron scarcity of the open oceans. A global numerical model of ocean circulation, biogeochemistry and ecosystems suggests that Crocosphaera’s ability to reduce its iron-metalloenzyme inventory provides two advantages: It allows Crocosphaera to inhabit regions lower in iron and allows the same iron supply to support higher Crocosphaera biomass and nitrogen fixation than if they did not have this reduced iron requirement.",0.04906716,0.010131521,0.90990937,0.008964359,0.014593402,0.005722872,0.007407514,0.024889382,0.050209075,0.016704218,0.01274559,0.017215157,0.015881428,0.007041979,0.011609049,0.009534542,0.009113026,0.00593976,0.010615652,0.008205552,0.011495745,0.013140217,0.023196876,0.04216738,0.009568311,0.006868792,0.004113571,0.015299672,0.018673867,['insects'],[0.037037037037037],[1.0]

The locomotion of terrestrial gastropods is driven by a train of periodic muscle contractions (pedal waves) and relaxations (interwaves) that propagate from their tails to their heads. These ventral waves interact with a thin layer of mucus secreted by the animal that transmits propulsive forces to the ground. The exact mechanism by which these propulsive forces are generated is still a matter of controversy. Specifically, the exact role played by the complex rheological and adhesive properties of the mucus is not clear. To provide quantitative data that could shed light on this question, we use a newly developed technique to measure, with high temporal and spatial resolution, the propulsive forces that terrestrial gastropods generate while crawling on smooth flat surfaces. The traction force measurements demonstrate the importance of the finite yield stress of the mucus in generating thrust and are consistent with the surface of the ventral foot being lifted with the passage of each pedal wave. We also show that a forward propulsive force is generated beneath each stationary interwave and that this net forward component is balanced by the resistance caused by the outer rim of the ventral foot, which slides at the speed of the center of mass of the animal. Simultaneously, the animal pulls the rim laterally inward. Analysis of the traction forces reveals that the kinematics of the pedal waves is far more complex than previously thought, showing significant spatial variation (acceleration/deceleration) as the waves move from the tail to the head of the animal.",0.029866349,0.016602946,0.020277731,0.021121057,0.015530024,0.051406488,0.008651262,0.02151944,0.014601248,0.9346954,0.008492552,0.023717528,0.015634833,0.025540246,0.04139099,0.011514254,0.019735215,0.015628355,0.014068931,0.024240037,0.01854728,0.016315253,0.019327242,0.022493504,0.020119324,0.017456269,0.021843188,0.027017284,0.7324413,['tammar wallaby'],[0.02097902097902],[1.0]

The ommatidial heterogeneity in butterflies can be identified non-invasively by the colorful eye shine, the reflection from the tapetal mirror located at the proximal end of the ommatidia, which can be observed by epi-illumination microscopy. Since the color of eye shine is determined by the spectral properties of the ommatidia, it has been tentatively related to color vision. In the course of a survey of ommatidial heterogeneity in butterflies, we found that members of the pierid genus Anthocharis lack the eye shine. We therefore carried out anatomy of the eye of the yellow tip, Anthocharis scolymus, and correlated it with the absence of the tapetum. The butterfly tapetum is a remnant of the ancestral moth tapetum, a trait that has been completely lost in the papilionids and also, as now appears, in the genus Anthocharis. Anatomical investigations also revealed that, considering rhabdom shape, peri-rhabdomal pigment clusters and autofluorescence, the ommatidia can be divided in at least two different types, which are randomly distributed in the retina.",0.013590796,0.7194249,0.0109921,0.009981793,0.007897605,0.014637524,0.006452503,0.010962994,0.009825578,0.010893965,0.003445339,0.005199967,0.008370094,0.009737668,0.011128476,0.004531057,0.007441002,0.043505594,0.007784837,0.008850408,0.010361344,0.007144873,0.01949581,0.009334568,0.007207174,0.008910339,0.009982152,0.010848203,0.012992637,"['plants', 'utricularia']","[0.017543859649122, 0.017543859649122]","[1.0, 1.0]"

This paper focuses on the high-aspect-ratio, load-bearing, glassy skeletal fibers (spicules) of the marine sponge Euplectella aspergillum. Considering that the spicules’ internal architecture cannot be repaired or remodeled, we hypothesize that there is a connection between their internal structure and their strength. Using a newly developed structural mechanics model for composite beams, we demonstrate that the unique internal geometry that maximizes a beam’s strength correlates well with the geometry observed in the native spicules. This bio-inspired design strategy for increasing a beam's strength has implications for a new generation of man-made structural materials. To adapt to a wide range of physically demanding environmental conditions, biological systems have evolved a diverse variety of robust skeletal architectures. One such example, Euplectella aspergillum, is a sediment-dwelling marine sponge that is anchored into the sea floor by a flexible holdfast apparatus consisting of thousands of anchor spicules (long, hair-like glassy fibers). Each spicule is covered with recurved barbs and has an internal architecture consisting of a solid core of silica surrounded by an assembly of coaxial silica cylinders, each of which is separated by a thin organic layer. The thickness of each silica cylinder progressively decreases from the spicule’s core to its periphery, which we hypothesize is an adaptation for redistributing internal stresses, thus increasing the overall strength of each spicule. To evaluate this hypothesis, we created a spicule structural mechanics model, in which we fixed the radii of the silica cylinders such that the force transmitted from the surface barbs to the remainder of the skeletal system was maximized. Compared with measurements of these parameters in the native sponge spicules, our modeling results correlate remarkably well, highlighting the beneficial nature of this elastically heterogeneous lamellar design strategy. The structural principles obtained from this study thus provide potential design insights for the fabrication of high-strength beams for load-bearing applications through the modification of their internal architecture, rather than their external geometry.",0.010723361,0.011219666,0.022249397,0.010296603,0.84948546,0.013236758,0.041576944,0.030945022,0.011114102,0.021666529,0.013473175,0.008408007,0.015883425,0.013622425,0.013170872,0.012565889,0.028859252,0.017413236,0.014316788,0.01157314,0.022262737,0.008632434,0.013717815,0.019253734,0.8534648,0.017454976,0.07260691,0.014326003,0.01122302,"['sea anemones', 'anthopleura xanthogrammica', 'metridium senile']","[0.022471910112359002, 0.011235955056179001, 0.011235955056179001]","[1.0, 0.5, 0.5]"

In vitro calcium carbonate precipitation experiments indicate that the SOM accelerates the conversion of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) into its final crystalline product.

Unlike humans, most birds perceive UV light and several species communicate using the near UV spectrum. Indeed, UV reflectance in addition to the colour of songbird feathers has been recognized as an important signal when choosing a mate. The king penguin is endowed with several highly coloured ornaments, notably its beak horn and breast and auricular plumage, but only its beak reflects UV, a property considered to influence its sexual attraction. Because no avian UV-reflecting pigments have yet been identified, the origin of such reflections is probably structural. In an attempt to identify the structures that give rise to UV reflectance, we combined reflectance spectrophotometry and morphological analysis by both light and electron microscopy, after experimental removal of surface layers of the beak horn.

Fifteen populations of D. pulchra covering a distance of 650 km of temperate southeastern Australia were sampled. Concentrations of the 4 main furanones in D. pulchra (Compounds 1 to 4) showed large variability but there was no latitudinal trend to this variation. We found significant variation in the concentrations of both total and individual furanones among locations, between summer and winter, and between different life-history stages. Importantly, the range of total furanone concentration among plants within locations was large, often varying by an order of magnitude or more. A total of 5 species of herbivorous fish, 7 species of macroinvertebrate grazer and 6 groups of mesograzer (of varying taxonomic level) were found at the 15 locations. The abundance of both total macroinvertebrate grazers and total mesograzers known to consume D. pul- chra varied significantly among locations. However, correlations between furanones and the abun- dance of macroinvertebrate grazers and mesograzers at the scale of location were all weak and non- significant, as was the correlation between furanones and the abundance of epiphytes on D. pulchra. The large variability in concentrations of furanones, and the absence of any positive relationships between furanones, herbivores and epiphytes, suggest that quantitative variation in furanones in D. pulchra is not driven by population-level selection or induction, but is more likely to be a result of small-scale variation in environmental factors such as nutrients and light, and genetic differences among individual plants.",0.007261183,0.0073511,0.005239965,0.005216182,0.010010243,0.006482135,0.009822697,0.005601502,0.007856859,0.00931417,0.01100625,0.007637926,0.012279428,0.007047466,0.00659166,0.010480201,0.007534601,0.007362807,0.00611361,0.008610084,0.012119519,0.008192861,0.008841001,0.00828633,0.009205364,0.93042123,0.006977705,0.012067745,0.006916885,[],[],[]

Oilbirds breed and roost in caves, often at sufficient depth that no daylight can penetrate, and forage for fruits at night. Using standard microscopy techniques we investigated the retinal structure of oilbird eyes and used an ophthalmoscopic reflex technique to determine the parameters of these birds’ visual fields. The retina is dominated by small rod receptors (diameter 1.3±0.2 μm; length 18.6±0.6 μm) arranged in a banked structure that is unique among terrestrial vertebrates. This arrangement achieves a photoreceptor density that is the highest so far recorded (≈1,000,000 rods mm−2) in any vertebrate eye. Cone photoreceptors are, however, present in low numbers. The eye is relatively small (axial length 16.1±0.2 mm) with a maximum pupil diameter of 9.0±0.0 mm, achieving a light-gathering capacity that is the highest recorded in a bird (f-number ≈1.07). The binocular field has a maximum width of 38° and extends vertically through 100° with the bill projecting towards the lower periphery; a topography that suggests that vision is not used to control bill position. We propose that oilbird eyes are at one end of the continuum that juxtaposes the conflicting fundamental visual capacities of sensitivity and resolution. Thus, while oilbird visual sensitivity may be close to a maximum, visual resolution must be low. This explains why these birds employ other sensory cues, including olfaction and echolocation, in the control of their behaviour in low-light-level environments.",0.050832637,0.79604524,0.69255537,0.029795775,0.02755462,0.028774824,0.021992024,0.039172973,0.06628538,0.01054813,0.012700321,0.015002561,0.021793004,0.015243768,0.01417146,0.011743577,0.023797896,0.013904248,0.014408795,0.01709299,0.019873045,0.025283499,0.051724814,0.06598705,0.017459098,0.01563313,0.013268156,0.014620561,0.02902968,"['amphibians', 'red-backed salamander', 'plethodon cinereus', 'bacteria', 'janthinobacterium lividum', 'batrachochytrium dendrobatidis']","[0.014084507042253001, 0.0, 0.0, 0.04225352112676, 0.014084507042253001, 0.014084507042253001]","[0.33333333333333304, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304]"

Transmission electron microscopy studies confirm the presence of a layered lamellar structure of the upper cuticle of iridescent leaves. Modelling of these multi-layer structures suggests that they are responsible for the blue iridescence, confirming the link between the observed lamellae and the recorded optical properties. Comparison of blue and green leaves from the same plant indicates that the loss of the blue iridescence corresponds to a loss of the multi-layer structure. The results reported here do not support the idea that iridescence in plants acts to enhance light capture of photosynthetically important wavelengths. The reflectance of light in the range 600–700 nm is very similar for both iridescent and non-iridescent leaves.

The vast majority of known silks are large, repetitive proteins assembled into extended beta-sheet structures. Honeybees, however, have found a radically different evolutionary solution to the need for a building material. The 4 fibrous proteins of honeybee silk are small ( approximately 30 kDa each) and nonrepetitive and adopt a coiled coil structure. We examined silks from the 3 superfamilies of the Aculeata (Hymenoptera: Apocrita) by infrared spectroscopy and found coiled coil structure in bees (Apoidea) and in ants (Vespoidea) but not in parasitic wasps of the Chrysidoidea. We subsequently identified and sequenced the silk genes of bumblebees, bulldog ants, and weaver ants and compared these with honeybee silk genes. Each species produced orthologues of the 4 small fibroin proteins identified in honeybee silk. Each fibroin contained a continuous predicted coiled coil region of around 210 residues, flanked by 23-160 residue length N- and C-termini. The cores of the coiled coils were unusually rich in alanine. There was extensive sequence divergence among the bee and ant silk genes (<50% similarity between the alignable regions of bee and ant sequences), consistent with constant and equivalent divergence since the bee/ant split (estimated to be 155 Myr). Despite a high background level of sequence diversity, we have identified conserved design elements that we propose are essential to the assembly and function of coiled coil silks.",0.010581915,0.01295825,0.009704416,0.008779217,0.024621304,0.012270328,0.008208882,0.019160148,0.022493007,0.046672344,0.00859257,0.006029069,0.02276816,0.011439647,0.9212812,0.013330358,0.010607282,0.013269029,0.007624929,0.007898808,0.01560106,0.006673257,0.007802337,0.03396816,0.00740865,0.010540976,0.0259572,0.013635579,0.009672194,"['vertebrates', 'eastern mole', 'scalopus aquaticus']","[0.015384615384615, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

Its tarsi are oversized and collectively bear some 60,000 adhesive bristles, each with two terminal pads. While walking, the beetle commits but a small fraction of the bristles to contact with the substrate. But when assaulted, it presses its tarsi flatly down, thereby touching ground with all or nearly all of the bristles. Once so adhered, it can withstand pulling forces of up to 0.8 g ( approximately 60 times its body mass) for 2 min, and of higher magnitudes, up to >3 g, for shorter periods. Adhesion is secured by a liquid, most probably an oil. By adhering, the beetle is able to thwart attacking ants, given that it is able to cling more persistently than the ant persists in its assault.

In every species studied, disruption of an epithelial layer instantaneously generates endogenous electric fields, which have been proposed to be important in wound healing. The identity of signalling pathways that guide both cell migration to electric cues and electric-field-induced wound healing have not been elucidated at a genetic level. Here we show that electric fields, of a strength equal to those detected endogenously, direct cell migration during wound healing as a prime directional cue. Manipulation of endogenous wound electric fields affects wound healing in vivo. Electric stimulation triggers activation of Src and inositol–phospholipid signalling, which polarizes in the direction of cell migration. Notably, genetic disruption of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase-γ (PI(3)Kγ) decreases electric-field-induced signalling and abolishes directed movements of healing epithelium in response to electric signals. Deletion of the tumour suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) enhances signalling and electrotactic responses.

Draculin inhibits activated Factor X within seconds of incubation at near equimolar concentration (2-6 times on molar basis). Fitting the data to the equation for a tight-binding inhibitor gives a value for K(i)(K(d)) = 14.8+/-1.5 nM. The formation of the Draculin-FXa complex can be explained by a two-step mechanism, where for the first, reversible step, k(on) = 1.117 (+/- 0.169, S.E.M.) x 10(6) M(-1)s(-1) and k(off) = 15.388 (+/- 1.672) x 10(-3) s(-1), while for the second, irreversible step, which is concentration-independent, k(2) = 0.072 s(-1).

This noncompetitive mode of inhibition of Draculin is supported by the observation that Draculin, at concentrations giving complete inhibition, does not impair binding of p-aminobenzamidine to FXa.

These disturbances can impact forest stand dynamics in ways that help maintain and enhance many ecosystem values. Impacts are commonly assessed using timber production metrics based on average stand values, but metrics based on smaller scales are needed to assess impacts on nontimber resources. In this study, we developed a multivariate method of quantitatively characterizing individual canopy gaps in Douglas-fir/grand fir stands in the Blue Mountains of eastern Oregon. We then established a reference or target range of variability by profiling gaps according to numbers of snags, downed logs, gap size and shape, and recolonizing vegetation. Cluster analysis, multidimensional scaling, and classification trees were used with these profiles to quantify similarity among individual gaps. Gaps fell into four groups, which could be interpreted as three ecologically functional groups on the basis of their role in stand development. Gaps caused by the same agents commonly fell within the same functional group: (1) flooding, logging, spruce budworm, and windfall cause stand level impacts that reset the stand development sequence; (2) bark beetles, tree fall, and root diseases cause within stand impacts that altered the rate of stand development; and (3) stem decay and dwarf mistletoe, and, under some circumstances, all disturbance agents, could kill trees yet have no impact on stand development except create space into which neighboring trees expand. We present a simple test to monitor how gaps change with silvicultural manipulations. Results indicate that this method offers (1) a way to systematically guide silvicultural manipulations aimed at mimicking natural disturbances at the canopy gap scale, and (2) a way to monitor the effectiveness of such silvicultural treatments and management actions using gap-based silviculture prescriptions.",0.022789294,0.004855129,0.068577,0.003473155,0.01105424,0.003142709,0.008432791,0.006421586,0.15564278,0.00251565,0.004480783,0.007147058,0.008462187,0.006603555,0.004294741,0.011138625,0.004276409,0.005636296,0.005959004,0.010293978,0.002457783,0.011711622,0.005592476,0.01760613,0.003862275,0.006083245,0.002388386,0.004057994,0.005597912,"['piliostigma thonningii', 'crossopteryx febrifuga']","[0.010204081632653001, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0]"

Tentacles suspended perpendicular to flow responded to increasing velocity by increasing their sag. An analysis of tension in these tentacles, mathematically analogous to that applicable to suspension bridges, shows that sagging permits the tentacles to avoid increases in tension that would otherwise occur as flow increases. Force modulation was achieved by active muscular control rather than by passive material properties. Although these tentacles would certainly break in the experimental flows if they did not sag, the low tension achieved suggests that some other reason, such as limitations on the adherence of cilia and mucus, accounts for the level of tension observed. Because drag is maximum on tentacles oriented perpendicular to flow, reorientation of tentacles, either by sagging or by dangling parallel to flow, additionally reduces tension by reducing drag. Theoretical estimates of drag on tentacles oriented parallel to flow show that they are never in danger of being broken. Drag is sufficient, however, to assist in passive extension of tentacles. While reorientation is a common mode of drag reduction among marine organisms, sagging represents a novel mechanism of mediating structural forces resulting from flow.",0.009364791,0.003825472,0.013270566,0.002830576,0.87426686,0.005270968,0.022981524,0.022536626,0.010819311,0.013389654,0.006989669,0.003242169,0.004946789,0.004455599,0.009064177,0.009332015,0.005872644,0.006158042,0.006072219,0.003292836,0.01756596,0.003952395,0.009640137,0.006345376,0.013948686,0.008162539,0.016323766,0.007280692,0.007396661,"['tampa', 'florida manatee', 'manatees']","[0.012345679012345002, 0.037037037037037, 0.074074074074074]","[0.16666666666666602, 0.5, 1.0]"

Many systems, located on different parts of the body, involve surfaces with particular frictional properties. Such systems evolved to attach parts of the body to each other, or to attach an insect to the substratum by providing fast and reversible attachment/detachment. Among these systems, there are some that deal with predefined surfaces, and others, in which one surface remains unpredictable. The first type of system occurs, for example, in wing-locking devices and head-arresting systems and is called probabilistic fasteners. The second type is mainly represented by insect attachment pads of two alternative designs: hairy and smooth. The relationship between surface patterns and/or mechanical properties of materials of contact pairs results in two main working principles of the frictional devices: mechanical interlocking, or maximization of the contact area. We give an overview of the functional design of two main groups of friction-based attachment devices in insects: probabilistic fasteners and attachment pads.",0.009639382,0.007019532,0.008389025,0.015163016,0.011647674,0.006834414,0.005058949,0.008998609,0.009811545,0.8682937,0.005482554,0.010534969,0.009358591,0.01071007,0.21932414,0.007858376,0.007256238,0.008280713,0.008247659,0.007853778,0.005120665,0.009258368,0.008845921,0.014554894,0.008346672,0.008217299,0.009843817,0.013754101,0.03007854,"['florida manatee', 'manatees']","[0.022988505747126003, 0.011494252873563001]","[1.0, 0.5]"

To address this question, we obtained measurements of muscle activation (via electromyography), fascicle strain (via sonomicrometry) and muscle-tendon force (via tendon buckles) from the lateral gastrocnemius (LG) and plantaris (PL) muscles of tammar wallabies trained to hop on a level and an inclined (10°, 17.4% grade) treadmill at two speeds (3.3 m s-1 and 4.2 m s-1). Similar patterns of muscle activation, force and fascicle strain were observed under both level and incline conditions. This also corresponded to similar patterns of limb timing and movement (duty factor, limb contact time and hopping frequency). During both level and incline hopping, the LG and PL exhibited patterns of fascicle stretch and shortening that yielded low levels of net fascicle strain [LG: level, -1.0±4.6% (mean ± s.e.m.) vs incline, 0.6±4.5%; PL: level, 0.1±1.0% vs incline, 0.4±1.6%] and muscle work (LG: level, -8.4±8.4 J kg-1 muscle vs incline, -6.8±7.5 J kg-1 muscle; PL: level, -2.0±0.6 J kg-1 muscle vs incline, -1.4±0.7 J kg-1 muscle). Consequently, neither muscle significantly altered its contractile dynamics to do more work during incline hopping. Whereas electromyographic (EMG) phase, duration and intensity did not differ for the LG, the PL exhibited shorter but more intense periods of activation, together with reduced EMG phase (P<0.01), during incline versus level hopping. Our results indicate that design for spring-like tendon energy savings and economical muscle force generation is key for these two distal muscle-tendon units of the tammar wallaby, and the need to accommodate changes in work associated with level versus incline locomotion is achieved by more proximal muscles of the limb.",0.012848105,0.009447395,0.022909425,0.005190213,0.014439292,0.01962006,0.015222559,0.013840511,0.015040814,0.026911704,0.004501328,0.010210848,0.012055562,0.01156507,0.011439258,0.01696602,0.030954778,0.006790916,0.005155809,0.015643451,0.023451427,0.008241334,0.01577848,0.018266322,0.013389901,0.012969947,0.014558808,0.009496817,0.9514583,[],[],[]

Suction takes place after mechanical triggering and is owing to a release of stored elastic energy in the trap body accompanied by a very fast opening and closing of a trapdoor, which otherwise closes the trap entrance watertight. The exceptional trapping speed—far above human visual perception—impeded profound investigations until now. Using high-speed video imaging and special microscopy techniques, we obtained fully time-resolved recordings of the door movement. We found that this unique trapping mechanism conducts suction in less than a millisecond and therefore ranks among the fastest plant movements known. Fluid acceleration reaches very high values, leaving little chance for prey animals to escape. We discovered that the door deformation is morphologically predetermined, and actually performs a buckling/unbuckling process, including a complete trapdoor curvature inversion.

Despite doubling of yields of major grain crops since the 1950s, more than one in seven people suffer from malnutrition (1). Global population is growing; demand for food, especially meat, is increasing; much land most suitable for annual crops is already in use; and production of nonfood goods (e.g., biofuels) increasingly competes with food production for land (2). The best lands have soils at low or moderate risk of degradation under annual grain production but make up only 12.6% of global land area (16.5 million km2) (3). Supporting more than 50% of world population is another 43.7 million km2 of marginal lands (33.5% of global land area), at high risk of degradation under annual grain production but otherwise capable of producing crops (3). Global food security depends on annual grains—cereals, oilseeds, and legumes—planted on almost 70% of croplands, which combined supply a similar portion of human calories (4, 5). Annual grain production, though, often compromises essential ecosystem services, pushing some beyond sustainable boundaries (5). To ensure food and ecosystem security, farmers need more options to produce grains under different, generally less favorable circumstances than those under which increases in food security were achieved this past century.

S. pinnata accumulated 3.6-fold more Se and was tolerant to 20 μm selenate, while S. albescens suffered reduced growth, chlorosis and necrosis, impaired photosynthesis, and high levels of reactive oxygen species. Levels of ascorbic acid, glutathione, total sulfur, and nonprotein thiols were higher in S. pinnata, suggesting that Se tolerance may in part be due to increased antioxidants and up-regulated sulfur assimilation. S. pinnata had higher selenocysteine methyltransferase protein levels and, judged from liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, mainly accumulated the free amino acid methylselenocysteine, while S. albescens accumulated mainly the free amino acid selenocystathionine. S. albescens leaf x-ray absorption near-edge structure scans mainly detected a carbon-Se-carbon compound (presumably selenocystathionine) in addition to some selenocysteine and selenate. Thus, S. albescens may accumulate more toxic forms of Se in its leaves than S. pinnata. The species also showed different leaf Se sequestration patterns: while S. albescens showed a diffuse pattern, S. pinnata sequestered Se in localized epidermal cell clusters along leaf margins and tips, concentrated inside of epidermal cells. Transcript analyses of S. pinnata showed a constitutively higher expression of genes involved in sulfur assimilation, antioxidant activities, defense, and response to (methyl)jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, or ethylene. The levels of some of these hormones were constitutively elevated in S. pinnata compared with S. albescens, and leaf Se accumulation was slightly enhanced in both species when these hormones were supplied. Thus, defense-related phytohormones may play an important signaling role in the Se hyperaccumulation of S. pinnata, perhaps by constitutively up-regulating sulfur/Se assimilation followed by methylation of selenocysteine and the targeted sequestration of methylselenocysteine.",0.009062473,0.00415871,0.00854825,0.011304668,0.013178255,0.005566374,0.005732763,0.03489426,0.01567641,0.004970434,0.59960264,0.034167252,0.036072228,0.003587538,0.005761407,0.013838149,0.002621086,0.005489488,0.01706759,0.007930232,0.012240226,0.005750069,0.018375512,0.00912402,0.008803674,0.012846955,0.006011241,0.012732367,0.005327721,['oysters'],[0.046511627906976],[1.0]

Importantly, tolerance of anoxia is not strictly associated with entrance into metabolic dormancy associated with diapause II, but rather any embryo will respond to anoxia by entering into a state of anoxia-induced quiescence. Hypoxia causes a reduction in the rate of development, reduced heart rates, and reduced capacities for metabolic enzyme activity in both aerobic and anaerobic pathways. Embryos of A. limnaeus begin life as oxyconformers, and transition into oxyregulators near the completion of embryonic development. As this transition occurs, extreme anoxia tolerance is lost. The rate of early development is independent of oxygen partial pressure, despite the fact that the embryos are oxyconformers. This suggests a contribution from anaerobic pathways to support early development. However, the specific pathways supporting this metabolism are unknown. The response of A. limnaeus embryos to hypoxia and anoxia is unique compared to other fishes and most other vertebrates, and thus future studies on this species may lend insight into novel mechanisms that support survival during prolonged oxygen limitation.",0.010054575,0.004783581,0.010351925,0.004434001,0.007619397,0.004203052,0.016409911,0.007550028,0.032192614,0.006102798,0.037212864,0.04820425,0.007231829,0.005258582,0.010178983,0.83296835,0.003644471,0.007509266,0.01290712,0.011349439,0.005602099,0.007305928,0.20493437,0.012011934,0.008878817,0.01283651,0.005497061,0.03750283,0.010540001,[],[],[]

In this study, we examined the effects of these biopolymers' decomposition and transformation in the soil on their sorptive properties. The levels of cutin and cutan decreased by 35 and 30%, respectively, after 20 mo of incubation. Carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance and differential scanning calorimeter analyses suggested that the rigid (crystalline) polymethylene moieties of cutan decompose with time. This observation is in contrast to previous reports, which suggested that this alkyl-C moiety is resistant to biodegradation. Cutin, however, exhibited mainly decomposition of the mobile (amorphous) polymethylene moieties. Moreover, some of its degraded materials were transformed into humic materials. The phenanthrene sorption coefficient decreased by 80 and 37% with incubation time of the cutin and cutan samples, respectively. For 1-naphthol, the sorption capacity decreased by 90% due to cutin decomposition. With cutan, this parameter did not show any changes correlated with incubation time. Phenanthrene exhibited linear and reversible sorption isotherms. In contrast, pronounced desorption hysteresis was obtained for 1-naphthol with the 20-mo-incubated cutin sample and with all cutan samples. With all cutan samples, desorption hysteresis increased with decomposition. Our data suggest that the sorptive nature of both biopolymers was affected by soil decomposition.

Susceptibility to this disease varies among amphibian populations and species, and resistance appears to be attributable in part to the presence of antifungal microbial species associated with the skin of amphibians. The betaproteobacterium Janthinobacterium lividum has been isolated from the skins of several amphibian species and produces the antifungal metabolite violacein, which inhibits B. dendrobatidis. In this study, we added J. lividum to red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus) to obtain an increased range of violacein concentrations on the skin. Adding J. lividum to the skin of the salamander increased the concentration of violacein on the skin, which was strongly associated with survival after experimental exposure to B. dendrobatidis. As expected from previous work, some individuals that did not receive J. lividum and were exposed to B. dendrobatidis survived. These individuals had concentrations of bacterially produced violacein on their skins that were predicted to kill B. dendrobatidis. Our study suggests that a threshold violacein concentration of about 18 μM on a salamander's skin prevents mortality and morbidity caused by B. dendrobatidis. In addition, we show that over one-half of individuals in nature support antifungal bacteria that produce violacein, which suggests that there is a mutualism between violacein-producing bacteria and P. cinereus and that adding J. lividum is effective for protecting individuals that lack violacein-producing skin bacteria.",0.006487185,0.005261172,0.003189814,0.004685944,0.010568234,0.004043146,0.007690358,0.004737156,0.006054819,0.005524844,0.016862541,0.008104245,0.015616504,0.006416896,0.004954216,0.011370851,0.00583877,0.006881122,0.006226522,0.00489804,0.006325253,0.010180776,0.005237294,0.006336601,0.007764231,0.84239864,0.006259344,0.009189855,0.004504818,"['fishes', 'seals', 'seal', 'mammals']","[0.030303030303030002, 0.09090909090909001, 0.09090909090909001, 0.030303030303030002]","[0.33333333333333304, 1.0, 1.0, 0.33333333333333304]"

Levels of wax ester in the copepods were correlated with depth, with deeper animals containing higher amounts. An unsaturation index was used to determine the proportions of polyunsaturated wax esters in the oil sac of the copepods. The proportion of polyunsaturated wax ester in copepods that had descended to depth was always close to 50% and attributable to high amounts of the diatom biomarker fatty acid 20:5(n-3) contained in these storage lipids. High-pressure differential scanning calorimetry indicated that wax esters with such high levels of unsaturation exhibited unusual properties, changing from a liquid to a solid phase at pressures and temperatures below 500 m in the ocean. The dense, solid wax esters reduce the overall buoyancy of the lipid-rich copepods at depth and help facilitate neutral buoyancy. The composition of wax esters is a key factor in buoyancy control in these organisms during diapause. Many calanoid copepods inhabiting high-latitude environments overwinter at great depths in the oceans in a state of diapause, a condition where metabolic processes are either arrested or greatly reduced (Dahms 1995). A fundamental requirement of successful overwintering is the acquisition of substantial lipid reserves during summer when microplankton and particularly diatom production is",0.012751016,0.002565097,0.004514507,0.004512232,0.004233762,0.011854935,0.003241104,0.011154039,0.008605221,0.018247904,0.011423793,0.057405878,0.003559803,0.003334293,0.003262826,0.017177893,0.003095798,0.005809953,0.051298935,0.011882545,0.005713631,0.004968477,0.12906963,0.010944976,0.005827093,0.004933791,0.002862981,0.006094402,0.004681416,['mammals'],[0.020408163265306003],[1.0]

1. At high latitudes, evolutionary adaptations focus on those that maximize survival, with hibernation being a major one used by many smaller mammals. Typically, mammalian hibernators overwinter in sites that are ≈0°C. However, in arctic regions, such sites do not exist, necessitating hibernation at sites well below 0°C. Lipid, the normal fuel of most hibernators, may not provide sufficient glucose needed by certain tissues to permit survival, with muscle breakdown being required. Critical to enhancing muscle stores are high concentrations of anabolic androgens prior to hibernation when the gonads are inactive. 
 
2. We compare and contrast androgen levels in arctic ground squirrels (AGS) (Urocitellus parryii Richardson) from the Yukon and Columbian ground squirrel (CGS) (U. columbianus Ord) from southern Alberta. 
 
3. In males, changes in testes mass over the active season were similar between AGS and CGS. In contrast, during the breeding and the nonbreeding, pre-hibernation periods, androgen levels in AGS were 6–10 and 20–25 times, respectively, those of CGS. From the breeding to the pre-hibernation periods, androgen levels declined 41% in AGS, but 86% in CGS. In females, androgen levels in AGS were high throughout the active season and, prior to hibernation, were 24 times those in CGS. 
 
4. In pre-hibernating AGS, we determined the source of these high androgen levels from two studies. First, using a hormonal challenge protocol to probe the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, we found that androgen levels in both females and males decreased ≥10% in response to suppression by dexamethasone (an artificial glucocorticoid that inhibits ACTH release) and increased ≥18% in response to direct adrenal stimulation by adrenocorticorticotropic homone (ACTH). Second, by sequential hormonal injections in males of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and of ACTH coupled with gonadectomy (GDX), followed by adrenalectomy (ADX), we found that GnRH had no effect, whereas ACTH stimulated androgen levels by >40%, both before and after GDX. After ADX, levels fell by 80%. Thus, the adrenals, not the gonads, are the source of these androgens. 
 
5. We hypothesize that pre-hibernating AGS have evolved a solution seen in no other known mammal: exploiting the benefits of high adrenal androgen levels prior to hibernation to build muscle that is then catabolized overwinter. The unknown is how AGS have mitigated the costs of these high androgen levels.",0.008374721,0.008789821,0.010757685,0.00567327,0.024606032,0.016113682,0.014500159,0.007240464,0.016314955,0.006201333,0.01494114,0.006179637,0.007537094,0.006034466,0.005446735,0.03195522,0.015831416,0.007548381,0.005282128,0.009465654,0.011159941,0.00705994,0.9457284,0.005017773,0.011618758,0.00925731,0.005593435,0.009777092,0.016884333,['bacteria'],[0.066666666666666],[1.0]

Ecosystem engineering by a single species can have a cascading effect on many ecosystem processes. While the impact of above-ground ecological engineers on soil chemical properties has been studied, few studies have assessed their impact on the soil microbial community, which is largely responsible for many ecosystem functions.

2. Utilizing a long-term experiment where birch was planted on heather moorland 20 years ago, the engineering impact of a single tree species (Betula pubescens) on the soil microbial community was assessed using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis and fungal polymerase chain reaction–denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). Changes in the soil microbial community were then related to soil chemical and physical variables and tree performance variables.

3. Under birch, total microbial biomass (total PLFA) declined, species richness increased and the ratio of fungal : bacterial PLFA declined. The fungal PLFA marker increased with increasing organic matter and depth of the LFH and O soil horizons, characteristics associated with moorland soils. Bacterial PLFAs increased with increasing birch canopy cover. The fungal community of the birch plots was different from that in the heather plots and changes in the fungal community composition were related to the size of the birch trees in the plots.

4. Changes in the soil microbial community were also related to changes in mineralizable N. Mineralizable N was correlated with both decreasing total soil microbial biomass and decreasing fungal : bacterial ratio.

5. The durability of the engineering effects of birch was studied in a second experiment. Plots were established in first-generation birch woodland that had developed on Calluna-dominated moorland. The plots were cleared of birch and planted with heather. After 20 years, there was no difference in the community composition of the PLFAs. In contrast, there were significant differences in the fungal community composition as judged by DGGE analysis, with the fungal community in the felled birch plots being similar to the heather moorland.

6. Synthesis. This work demonstrates that addition of a single tree species to heather moorland results in changes in below-ground soil microbial communities and in nutrient cycling.",0.009153057,0.001868101,0.002870997,0.003648671,0.003142158,0.002284227,0.001900021,0.005632647,0.008356893,0.002519536,0.01129901,0.012594635,0.007027637,0.003160575,0.002625803,0.016605686,0.001045002,0.003427473,0.020639125,0.003203176,0.002993545,0.002354371,0.029199751,0.002073249,0.003347727,0.007166672,0.001860054,0.008412226,0.00438896,[],[],[]

This phenotype arises by increasing the intrinsic O2 affinity of the hemoglobin (Hb) molecule, by decreasing the intracellular concentration of allosteric effectors (e.g., 2,3-diphosphoglycerate; DPG), or by suppressing the sensitivity of Hb to these physiological cofactors.ResultsHere we report that strictly fossorial eastern moles (Scalopus aquaticus) have evolved a low O2 affinity, DPG-insensitive Hb - contrary to expectations for a mammalian species that is adapted to the chronic hypoxia and hypercapnia of subterranean burrow systems. Molecular modelling indicates that this functional shift is principally attributable to a single charge altering amino acid substitution in the β-type δ-globin chain (δ136Gly→Glu) of this species that perturbs electrostatic interactions between the dimer subunits via formation of an intra-chain salt-bridge with δ82Lys. However, this replacement also abolishes key binding sites for the red blood cell effectors Cl-, lactate and DPG (the latter of which is virtually absent from the red cells of this species) at δ82Lys, thereby markedly reducing competition for carbamate formation (CO2 binding) at the δ-chain N-termini.ConclusionsWe propose this Hb phenotype illustrates a novel mechanism for adaptively elevating the CO2 carrying capacity of eastern mole blood during burst tunnelling activities associated with subterranean habitation.",0.013943505,0.002912259,0.006788321,0.002722193,0.005020144,0.002960763,0.004027498,0.005868937,0.007896503,0.002971364,0.011040596,0.004529208,0.003681499,0.001374987,0.002503598,0.03127583,0.00137947,0.004680621,0.004631191,0.00501738,0.004155658,0.002907396,0.18449184,0.00392003,0.003380665,0.002985349,0.001861394,0.005808554,0.006631286,['bacteria'],[0.034482758620689],[1.0]

Examining adaptations to anoxic/hypoxic survival in hypoxia-tolerant animals may offer fresh ideas for the treatment of hypoxia-related diseases. Here, we summarise our present knowledge of two fishes that have evolved to survive hypoxia under very different circumstances. The crucian carp (Carassius carassius) is of particular interest because of its extreme anoxia tolerance. During the long North European winter, it survives for months in completely oxygen-deprived freshwater habitats. The crucian carp also tolerates a few days of anoxia at room temperature and, unlike anoxia-tolerant freshwater turtles, it is still physically active in anoxia. Moreover, the crucian carp does not appear to reduce neuronal ion permeability during anoxia and may primarily rely on more subtle neuromodulatory mechanisms for anoxic metabolic depression. The epaulette shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) is a tropical marine vertebrate. It lives on shallow reef platforms that repeatedly become cut off from the ocean during periods of low tides. During nocturnal low tides, the water [O2] can fall by 80% due to respiration of the coral and associated organisms. Since the tides become lower and lower over a period of a few days, the hypoxic exposure during subsequent low tides will become progressively longer and more severe. Thus, this shark is under a natural hypoxic preconditioning regimen. Interestingly, hypoxic preconditioning lowers its metabolic rate and its critical PO2. Moreover, repeated anoxia appears to stimulate metabolic depression in an adenosine-dependent way.",0.007545824,0.004096204,0.005094208,0.00326802,0.005655654,0.006857293,0.005135858,0.003043816,0.01233775,0.002685885,0.018003639,0.00438102,0.00453821,0.0017794,0.003313707,0.054849546,0.002154134,0.004834307,0.00348116,0.005672186,0.00541354,0.004233125,0.49066976,0.003088776,0.004303313,0.003479019,0.003822987,0.00739783,0.0061062,[],[],[]

In this study I analyzed the 3D kinematics of sugar gliders (Petaurus breviceps) during short glides in an enclosed space. Short segments of the glide were captured on video, and the positions of marked anatomical landmarks were used to compute linear distances and angles, as well as whole body velocities and accelerations. From the whole body accelerations I estimated the aerodynamic forces generated by the animals. I computed the correlations between movements of the limbs and body rotations to examine the control of orientation during flight. Finally, I compared these results to those of my earlier study on the similarly sized and distantly related southern flying squirrel (Glaucomys volans). The sugar gliders in this study accelerated downward slightly (1.0±0.5 m s–2), and also accelerated forward (2.1±0.6 m s–2) in all but one trial, indicating that the body weight was not fully supported by aerodynamic forces and that some of the lift produced forward acceleration rather than just balancing body weight. The gliders used high angles of attack (44.15±3.12°), far higher than the angles at which airplane wings would stall, yet generated higher lift coefficients (1.48±0.18) than would be expected for a stalled wing. Movements of the limbs were strongly correlated with body rotations, suggesting that sugar gliders make extensive use of limb movements to control their orientation during gliding flight. In addition, among individuals, different limb movements were associated with a given body rotation, suggesting that individual variation exists in the control of body rotations. Under similar conditions, flying squirrels generated higher lift coefficients and lower drag coefficients than sugar gliders, yet had only marginally shallower glides. Flying squirrels have a number of morphological specializations not shared by sugar gliders that may help to explain their greater lift generating performance.",0.008763976,0.01739061,0.010835256,0.005272969,0.019739518,0.18386304,0.014139,0.00586607,0.014945302,0.005890616,0.006610842,0.006947282,0.010565697,0.009885828,0.008818954,0.006202418,0.69610065,0.006910684,0.009307366,0.06731818,0.01794356,0.011841157,0.04402416,0.011156753,0.009127984,0.011104981,0.011018974,0.006291986,0.024360776,['escherichia coli'],[0.0],[0]

In the experiments described here two animals were trained to give preference to the radiation emitted by a warm signal unit (the negative unit was left at room temperature). The distance between the decision line and the signal units was 8, 12 or 16 cm. Both animals responded to radiation as low as 0.5 × 10−4 W cm−2 (Fig. 3).2.Based on calculations of the radiation emitted by the human skin, vampires should be capable of detecting warm-blooded animals at a distance up to 16 cm (Fig. 4). This sense for thermal radiation may aid these bats in localizing or selecting a suitable biting site.3.Histological studies of the bats' facial structures indicate that thermal stimuli are most probably perceived in the three pits surrounding the central nose leaf: the thin, hairless and glandless skin is underlaid with dense connective tissue. Thermography reveals that the surface temperature of the nasal region is up to 9 °C lower than that of the neighboring parts of the face (Fig. 2).",0.00912703,0.020971023,0.00709708,0.006378056,0.008228934,0.010779822,0.007662716,0.004988488,0.007682968,0.007407819,0.011562944,0.005156269,0.006993076,0.00565382,0.003968266,0.011645451,0.005583459,0.009005004,0.005634632,0.007344829,0.009066219,0.007523036,0.93476,0.003397347,0.007798384,0.007716478,0.006615358,0.008685223,0.008780399,[],[],[]

The sonar clicks typically have a duration of about 40 to 50 ms and can be classified as continuous, double or single. Agonistic squawks typically have a duration of about 0.5 s and contain multiple harmonic components (Figs. 5, 6).2.Both sonar clicks and agonistic squawks are initiated by contraction of the sternotrachealis muscles (Figs. 7 and 16) which stretch the trachea, reducing the tension across the syrinx and causing the cartilaginous bronchial semi-rings supporting the cranial and caudal edges of the external tympaniform membranes (ETM) to hinge inward, folding the ETM into the syringeal lumen (Fig. 17). Bernoulli forces created by expiratory air flowing through the restricted syringeal aperture presumably initiate vibration of the internal and/or external tympaniform membranes.3.Social vocalizations such as the agonistic squawk, continue until the sternotrachealis muscles relax (Fig. 10), allowing the cranial portion of the bronchus to move anteriad and abducting the ETM.4.Sonar clicks are terminated by rapid contraction of a previously undescribed intrinsic syringeal muscle, the broncholateralis, which inserts on the semi-ring supporting the anterior edge of the ETM and causes it to rotate about its articulation with the next anterior bronchial cartilage in such a way that it abducts the ETM (Figs. 8, 16, 17). Musculus broncholateralis contracts only during sonar clicks, appears to have a high proportion of twitch-type fibers, and is specialized for the rapid abduction of the ETM to produce short duration, click-like vocalizations.5.Tracheal airflow and sternal air sac pressure reflect the changes in the syringeal aperture. Tracheal airflow at first increases as expiratory effort increases subsyringeal pressure. The initial high rate of airflow drops at the onset of phonation due to the increased syringeal resistance. In the case of a double click, airflow momentarily ceases during the intraclick interval when the ETM temporarily closes the syrinx. Air sac pressure rises to its maximum level at this time. Expiratory airflow rapidly increases as the ETM is abducted from either its closed or phonatory position to its open, resting position. Each sonar click requires about 1 cm3 of air; a typical agonistic squawk may use about 27 cm3 of air (Figs. 11, 12, 13; Tables 3, 4).6.Each sonar click is often accompanied by a complete respiratory cycle or ‘mini-breath’ (Fig. 11). Pulmonary ventilation can be controlled independently from the clicking rate by varying the tidal volume of the mini-breaths, which may be as small as the tracheal and bronchial dead space. Mini-breaths permit oilbirds to produce click trains having a long train duration uninterrupted by a long inspiration.7.A dual flow probe was used to simultaneously measure the rate of airflow through each semi-syrinx during vocalization. The rate of airflow through the right semi-syrinx was 40 to 60% greater than that through the left. Both syringes functioned together except during the middle portion of some continuous type sonar clicks when sound was sometimes generated only by one semi-syrinx, the other being closed (Figs. 14, 15; Tables 5, 6).8.The fluid subsyringeal power reaches approximately 100 and 150 mW in the left and right semi-syrinx, respectively, during the second member of a double sonar click (Table 6). Total syringeal power during agonistic squawks reaches at least 60 mW and syringeal resistance during these vocalizations is as high as 1500 cm H20/LPS (Table 7).",0.016127007,0.004341242,0.007224401,0.015743203,0.007141535,0.006611182,0.002905082,0.003892448,0.004934772,0.030811703,0.002104743,0.00345209,0.005516325,0.026238708,0.006480909,0.002147917,0.057682168,0.013306766,0.01021399,0.004418328,0.00463823,0.021728331,0.001948633,0.016916238,0.003864362,0.005779978,0.003164568,0.005055087,0.009853289,"['bacteria', 'plants', 'nematodes', 'nematode']","[0.036363636363636, 0.018181818181818, 0.018181818181818, 0.018181818181818]","[1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]"

Yet, quantitative evidence for the alleged functions, e.g., efficient water and nutrient uptake, nutrient retention, reduction of water loss, mechanical protection, or the avoidance of overheating, is rare or missing. We tested the notion originally put forward by Went in 1940 that the velamen allows plants to capture and immobilize the first solutions arriving in a rainfall, which are the most heavily charged with nutrients. In a series of experiments, we examined whether all necessary functional characteristics are given for this scenario to be realistic under ecological conditions. First, we show that the velamen of a large number of orchid species takes up solutions within seconds, while evaporation from the velamen takes several hours. Charged ions are retained in the velamen probably due to positive and negative charges in the cell walls, while uncharged compounds are lost to the external medium.

In aquatic environments, the biofouling process is assumed to initiate from the conditioning layer of absorbed organic carbon residues on wetted surfaces. Microfouling organisms attach to this conditioning layer, building up a biofilm on which further biofouling proceeds. In dolphins, biofouling reduces hydrodynamic efficiency and may negatively affect health if not managed. In the present study we examined the skin surface of the pilot whale (Globicephalamelas). Employing cryo-scanning electron microscopic techniques combined with various sample preparations, the skin displayed an average nanorough surface characterized by a pattern of nanoridge-enclosed pores; the average pore size (approximately 0.20 µm2) was below the size of most marine biofouling organisms. Further, the implications of this type of surface to the self-cleaning abilities of the skin of pilot whales are discussed, based on reduced available space for biofouler attachment, the lack of any particular microniches as shelters for biofoulers, and the challenges of turbulent water flow and liquid–air interfaces during surfacing and jumping of the dolphin.",0.008437217,0.008969249,0.007549363,0.01673221,0.016272383,0.009609625,0.011773775,0.010629138,0.00656679,0.022020463,0.017654667,0.007960639,0.20560253,0.026690802,0.005418086,0.007014764,0.014071762,0.010965725,0.014884436,0.009470555,0.016003836,0.010097237,0.009619691,0.007336535,0.14926477,0.8284383,0.018729368,0.048193697,0.013269149,"['mountain pine', 'pinus mugo', 'pine']","[0.020408163265306003, 0.020408163265306003, 0.020408163265306003]","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0]"

Savanna fires are mild, frequent, and supposed to affect tree recruitment rather than adult survival: trunk profile and growth rate of young trees between two successive fires can also affect survival. These factors and fire severity were measured on a sample of 20 trees near the recruitment stage of two savanna species chosen for their contrasted fire resistance strategies (Crossopteryx febrifuga and Piliostigma thonningii). Crossopteryx has a higher intrinsic resistance to fire (bark properties) than Piliostigma: a 20-mm-diameter stem of Crossopteryx survives exposure to 650°C, while Piliostigma needs a diameter of at least 40 mm to survive. Crossopteryx has a thicker trunk than Piliostigma: for two trees of the same height, the basal diameter of Crossopteryx will be 1.6 times greater. Piliostigma grows 2.26 times faster than Crossopteryx between two successive fires. The two species have different fire resistance strategies: one relies on resistance of aboveground structures to fire, while the other relies on its ability to quickly re-build aboveground structures. Crossopteryx is able to recruit in almost any fire conditions while Piliostigma needs locally or temporarily milder fire conditions. In savannas, fire resistance is a complex property which cannot be assessed simply by measuring only one of its components, such as bark thickness. Bark properties, trunk profile and growth rate define strategies of fire resistance. Fire resistance may interact with competition: we suggest that differences in fire resistance strategies have important effects on the structure and dynamics of savanna ecosystems.",0.039221082,0.001323532,0.019018788,0.002255767,0.018454002,0.001572233,0.007618733,0.003983611,0.01483684,0.002555664,0.004886053,0.005004602,0.005428382,0.006520668,0.002955083,0.013385712,0.004425831,0.003742304,0.022066103,0.002975509,0.006442848,0.00503853,0.017978277,0.007802647,0.003911515,0.002899499,0.001691918,0.002664949,0.002972561,"['toadfish', 'acipenser baerii', 'opsanus beta', 'fish', 'chiloscyllium plagiosum', 'opsanus', 'bamboo', 'sturgeon', 'siberian sturgeon', 'fishes', 'gulf toadfish', 'lampetra fluviatilis']","[0.013698630136986, 0.013698630136986, 0.013698630136986, 0.054794520547945, 0.013698630136986, 0.013698630136986, 0.013698630136986, 0.027397260273972, 0.0, 0.027397260273972, 0.013698630136986, 0.013698630136986]","[0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 1.0, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.25]"

Leaf structures of plants on the other hand, have developed a series of technological adaptations, which allow them to limit their temperature to 40–45°C in full sunlight, even if water evaporation is suppressed. This is accomplished by several strategies such as limitation of leaf size, optimization of aerodynamics in wind, limitation of absorbed solar energy only to the useful fraction of radiation and by efficient thermal emission. Optical and infrared thermographic measurements under a solar simulator and in a streaming channel were used to investigate the corresponding properties of leaves and to identify suitable bionic model systems. Experiments started with the serrated structure of ordinary green leaves distributed over typical twig structures and finally identified the Australian palm tree Licuala ramsayi as a more useful bionic model.

• Epicormic bud producing structures in the eucalypts, a large group of woody plants of considerable ecological, horticultural and silvicultural importance, are described here. 
• The outer portion of epicormic strands excised from the bark of large diameter stems of 18 Eucalyptus species, two Angophora species and Lophostemon confertus was examined anatomically in semithin sections. 
• In the inner bark each eucalypt strand usually possessed 5–12 radially orientated strips of tissue of meristematic appearance. The meristem strips were c. 30–50 µm high, 70–110 µm wide and 2000–10 000 µm long, with a lacuna above the meristem surface. Few buds or bud primordia were associated with the strands and the strands appeared to have a reduced regenerative potential in the outer bark. 
• In most angiosperm trees dormant epicormic buds are present in the outer bark, a position where they could be killed by fire. By contrast, in eucalypts the greatest epicormic bud initiation potential is at the level of the vascular cambium, which is protected by the maximum bark thickness. This might explain the pronounced ability of eucalypts to produce bole and branch epicormic shoots after moderate to intense fire.",0.019534986,0.002793667,0.070861384,0.002671874,0.009134606,0.0011652,0.007761546,0.009767864,0.032547947,0.003269697,0.004750729,0.037329234,0.004207945,0.006600556,0.005436542,0.025943894,0.005093698,0.004550369,0.033339627,0.003328214,0.006583113,0.006567658,0.01771068,0.009087459,0.004428471,0.002384739,0.002135073,0.005905555,0.004130064,['athous haemorrhoidalis'],[0.0],[0]

After dissolving the protein matrix of chitin‐protein microfibrils with NaOH, the orientation of the axial chitin fibers was three‐dimensionally demonstrated. Microfibrils of the outermost exocuticular lamella lie parallel to the slope of the cone surface of the MT and rotate slightly on the top of the MT. Microfibrils of the external lamella of the transitional area between planar cuticle and conical cuticle of the MT corresponded to the shape of the surface within one lamella and preferred directions of MT's microfibrils in the successive lamella rotated. In the deeper layers of the cuticle, the rotation of both the microfibrils and successive lamella results in the twisted straw architecture of the microfibrils' composition within the MT. The deepest microfibrils that are located close to the axis of the MT form compact clusters of fibrils (1.0–1.5 μm length). The twisted‐straw architecture of microfibrils in the MT is derived from principles of development of extracellular fibrous composites. It is suggested, however, that this architecture has an additional functional significance as a strategic design with particular mechanical properties. J.

An example of outstanding impact resistance is the pummelo fruit (Citrus maxima) which can drop from heights of 10 m and more without showing significant outer damage. Our data suggest that this impact resistance is due to the hierarchical organization of the fruit peel, called pericarp. The project presented in the current paper aims at transferring structural features from the pummelo pericarp to engineering materials, in our case metal foams, produced by the investment casting process. The transfer necessitates a detailed structural and mechanical analysis of the biological model on the one hand, and the identification and development of adequate materials and processes on the other hand. Based on this analysis, engineering composite foam structures are developed and processed which show enhanced damping and impact properties. The modified investment casting process and the model alloy Bi57Sn43 proved to be excellent candidates to make these bio-inspired structures. Mechanical testing of both the natural and the engineering structures has to consider the necessity to evaluate the impact of the different hierarchical features. Therefore, specimens of largely varying sizes have to be tested and size effects cannot be ignored, especially as the engineering structures might be upscaled in comparison with the natural role model. All in all, the present results are very promising: the basis for a transfer of bio-inspired structural hierarchical levels has been set.",0.005735183,0.005184794,0.004849173,0.004190557,0.45466527,0.008036061,0.02398664,0.004990539,0.003369929,0.006626865,0.005662182,0.004066548,0.007505283,0.00571329,0.004873371,0.00418139,0.015728492,0.005039412,0.006833152,0.005610994,0.016387139,0.005538701,0.004869291,0.00909538,0.35201663,0.010738976,0.19440854,0.010061052,0.009211054,"['fucus vesiculosus', 'staphylococcus aureus']","[0.014705882352941001, 0.014705882352941001]","[1.0, 1.0]"

Chemical identification of PRKs will facilitate the study of predator-prey interactions and the risk of predation, and when the prey are pests, will potentially provide environmentally friendly means of pest control. In temporary pools of the Mediterranean and Middle East, larvae of the mosquito Culiseta longiareolata Macquart are highly vulnerable to the common predatory backswimmer, Notonecta maculata Fabricius. We demonstrate that N. maculata releases two hydrocarbons, n-heneicosane and n-tricosane, which repel ovipositing females of C. longiareolata. In behavioural tests with environmentally relevant chemical concentrations in outdoor mesocosm experiments, the repellent effects of the two compounds were additive at the tested concentrations.",0.030713871,0.022764977,0.011666369,0.10195347,0.01177746,0.006065564,0.009049707,0.007465342,0.006159583,0.013908911,0.005891133,0.011514128,0.015650347,0.837178,0.009629699,0.009382131,0.025578408,0.011881151,0.020148152,0.006050493,0.006110551,0.016542003,0.011518878,0.011353657,0.017759284,0.012198648,0.014326893,0.016190775,0.01873231,"['flea beetles', 'galerucinae', 'chrysomelidae', 'insects', 'beetles', 'alticini', 'coleoptera']","[0.054545454545454, 0.018181818181818, 0.018181818181818, 0.018181818181818, 0.054545454545454, 0.018181818181818, 0.018181818181818]","[1.0, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304, 1.0, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304]"

Captive manatees were fed six species of aquatic vegetation normally eaten in the wild (four freshwater species and two seagrasses). Inanimate objects were placed in the holding tanks with manatees at Lowry Park Zoological Gardens (Tampa, FL) to determine the degree to which perioral bristles were used in exploration and to define the range of manipulative behavior. In addition, behavioral observations were made on the use of perioral bristles during social interactions with conspecifics. Observations were recorded using a Hi8-format video camera. Florida manatees possess an unusually large degree of fine motor control of the snout and perioral bristles. The large and robust perioral bristle fields of the upper lip were used in a prehensile manner during feeding. Bristle use by manatees feeding on submerged vegetation differed from that seen during feeding on floating vegetation. Other behavioral use of the perioral bristles shows variation depending upon the situation encountered. The degree of plasticity of perioral bristle use supports our hypothesis that the vibrissal-muscular complex of the Florida manatee has evolved to increase the efficiency of grazing and browsing on aquatic vegetation and to fully maximize the potential of the manatee as a generalist feeder. The manipulative and sensitive nature of the manatee snout is likely a manifestation of a complex sensory and motor system which has evolved for marine mammal aquatic herbivores living in shallow turbid habitats.",0.003624857,0.003622648,0.005779328,0.008778611,0.004438782,0.010744297,0.00398475,0.004705377,0.03448032,0.15536407,0.002932129,0.006590305,0.00388608,0.008153429,0.02087936,0.00787516,0.006052856,0.005348091,0.00386059,0.0031562,0.005568502,0.009989251,0.00332694,0.010994785,0.002703403,0.005854177,0.006846672,0.014480193,0.12997982,"['dispar', 'black poplar', 'populus nigra', 'bacteria', 'plants', 'poplar', 'lymantria dispar', 'gypsy moth']","[0.020408163265306003, 0.0, 0.0, 0.020408163265306003, 0.020408163265306003, 0.020408163265306003, 0.0, 0.020408163265306003]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]"

Muscles identified include the M. levator nasolabialis, M. buccinatorius, M. maxillonasolabialis, M. centralis nasi, M. lateralis nasi, M. spbincter colli profundus pars oris, M. orbicularis oris, M. mandibularis, and M. mentalis. A new muscle, M. centralis nasi, has been named and is an integral part of perioral bristle movement. The snout of the Florida manatee is capable of performing complex movements. The prehensile ability of Florida manatees can be explained in the context of a muscular hydrostat as defined by Kier and Smith (1985). Eversion of certain bristles in the upper lip occurs by shortening longitudinal, transverse, and semicircular muscles in combination with volume displacement due to compensatory changes in the shape of the snout. Midline sweeping of these bristles is accomplished by the contraction of M. centralis nasi. Eversion of bristles on the lower jaw is a result of shortening of M. mentalis. Contraction of M. orbicularis oris pushes vegetation into the oral cavity. All observed movement patterns and uses of perioral bristles can be explained by variation of these sequences within the context of muscular hydrostat function.",0.005177796,0.008535876,0.010927103,0.004626915,0.009465359,0.01395636,0.010367995,0.009164122,0.037476577,0.01909615,0.002740293,0.006308449,0.009673496,0.006469139,0.021912256,0.013045748,0.036841977,0.006580844,0.004622393,0.00806526,0.01894988,0.006578771,0.005359734,0.017963039,0.005484193,0.009554506,0.013233497,0.019618321,0.71261495,['carausius morosus'],[0.09090909090909001],[1.0]

A method for rendering soluble the cement of Megabalanus rosa has been developed, and three major proteins have been identified in a previous study. To survey the M. rosa cement proteins in a lower molecular mass range, the cement proteins were separated by reversed-phase HPLC and a previously unidentified protein named 20 kDa M. rosa cement protein (Mrcp-20k) was found. Mrcp-20k cDNA was cloned to reveal its primary structure. This cDNA was 902 bp long and encoded a 202 amino acid-long open reading frame, including 19 amino acids of the signal sequence. The molecular mass in the disulphide form was calculated to be 20357 Da and the isoelectric point of the mature polypeptide was 4.72. Mrcp-20k was characterized by an abundance of Cys residues and charged amino acids. The most common amino acid was Cys (17.5%), with Asp (11.5%), Glu (10.4%) and His (10.4%) following in order of magnitude. The alignment of the Cys residues indicated the primary structure of this protein to consist of six degenerated repeats, each about 30 residues long. Mrcp-20k has no intermolecular disulphide bonds and no free thiol groups of Cys in the insoluble cement complex. Abundant Cys is thought to play a role in maintaining the topology of charged amino acids on the molecular surface by intramolecular disulphide-bond formation.

Cellulolysis occurs as the result of the combined action of fungi and bacteria with different requirements. Earthworms influence decomposition indirectly by affecting microbial population structure and dynamics and also directly because the guts of some species possess cellulolytic activity. Here we assess whether the earthworm Eisenia fetida (Savigny 1826) digests cellulose directly (i.e., with its associated gut microbiota) and also whether the effects of E. fetida on microbial biomass and activity lead to a change in the equilibrium between fungi and bacteria. By enhancing fungal communities, E. fetida would presumably trigger more efficient cellulose decomposition. To evaluate the role of E. fetida in cellulose decomposition, we carried out an experiment in which pig slurry, a microbial-rich substrate, was treated in small-scale vermireactors with and without earthworms. The presence of earthworms in vermireactors significantly increased the rate of cellulose decomposition (0.43 and 0.26% cellulose loss day−1, with and without earthworms, respectively). However, the direct contribution of E. fetida to degradation of cellulose was not significant, although its presence increased microbial biomass (Cmic) and enzyme activity (cellulase and β-glucosidase). Surprisingly, as fungi may be part of the diet of earthworms, the activity of E. fetida triggered fungal growth during vermicomposting. We suggest that this activation is a key step leading to more intense and efficient cellulolysis during vermicomposting of organic wastes.",0.009633229,0.006884371,0.012425161,0.008091369,0.007760437,0.005557017,0.005253202,0.024562867,0.010147098,0.007044517,0.019519854,0.005093542,0.7864649,0.007351493,0.013022028,0.006614522,0.007452971,0.007294359,0.008077255,0.008882846,0.006813738,0.006394289,0.008824111,0.007320772,0.008138623,0.0152589,0.007158968,0.00909541,0.008088893,"['schmallenberg virus', 'mouse', 'mice']","[0.0, 0.020408163265306003, 0.020408163265306003]","[0.0, 1.0, 1.0]"

In 13 bird families known to contain heterothermic species, the common poorwill (Phalaenoptilus nuttallii) is the only species that ostensibly hibernates. We used temperature-sensitive radio-transmitters to collect roost and skin temperature (Tskin) data, and winter roost preferences for free-ranging poorwills in southern Arizona. Further, to determine the effect of passive rewarming on torpor bout duration and active rewarming (i.e., the use of metabolic heat to increase Tskin), we experimentally shaded seven birds during winter to prevent them from passively rewarming via solar radiation. Poorwills selected winter roosts that were open to the south or southwest, facilitating passive solar warming in the late afternoon. Shaded birds actively rewarmed following at least 3 days of continuous torpor. Average torpor bout duration by shaded birds was 122 h and ranged from 91 to 164 h. Active rewarming by shaded birds occurred on significantly warmer days than those when poorwills remained torpid. One shaded bird remained inactive for 45 days, during which it spontaneously rewarmed actively on eight occasions. Our findings show that during winter poorwills exhibit physiological patterns and active rewarming similar to hibernating mammals.",0.010086386,0.019850465,0.012586745,0.006013729,0.017664518,0.019855518,0.013342901,0.00781921,0.011074609,0.008142866,0.012861447,0.005909032,0.008887323,0.006391036,0.005530028,0.022863152,0.012066783,0.008631731,0.006361731,0.012996644,0.010726223,0.007434056,0.9702757,0.005447027,0.011877648,0.01097231,0.00754672,0.011372265,0.01599759,['campylobacter jejuni'],[0.02127659574468],[1.0]

From a chemistry perspective, few details are available to illustrate how these shellfish construct such extensive reef systems. Experiments presented here show that oysters generate a biomineralized adhesive material for aggregating into large communities. This cement is an organic-inorganic hybrid and differs from the surrounding shells by displaying an alternate CaCO(3) crystal form, a cross-linked organic matrix, and an elevated protein content.

Although their function is known, the underlying molecular mechanism was not understood. Mutagenesis experiments questioned the previous assumption of hydrogen bonding as the dominant mechanism. We use terahertz spectroscopy to show that antifreeze activity is directly correlated with long-range collective hydration dynamics. Our results provide evidence for a new model of how AFGPs prevent water from freezing. We suggest that antifreeze activity may be induced because the AFGP perturbs the aqueous solvent over long distances. Retarded water dynamics in the large hydration shell does not favor freezing. The complexation of the carbohydrate cis-hydroxyl groups by borate suppresses the long-range hydration shell detected by terahertz absorption. The hydration dynamics shift toward bulk water behavior strongly reduces the AFGP antifreeze activity, further supporting our model.",0.006747191,0.007886491,0.004656962,0.003577227,0.006294739,0.006663889,0.006449955,0.006660979,0.010721387,0.006778067,0.015866872,0.00894907,0.004988299,0.004448587,0.00339365,0.034873847,0.004239197,0.008497066,0.006950061,0.01289835,0.009650185,0.004420674,0.8681423,0.004038427,0.007667145,0.008049703,0.005057589,0.03079962,0.010242045,"['plesiophthalmus davidis', 'insects', 'bacteria', 'plesiophthalmus', 'tenebrionidae', 'coleoptera']","[0.007692307692307001, 0.007692307692307001, 0.023076923076923002, 0.007692307692307001, 0.007692307692307001, 0.007692307692307001]","[0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304, 1.0, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304]"

Consensus decisions enable group members to maintain group cohesion and one way to reach consensus is to rely on quorums. A quorum response is where the probability of an activity change sharply increases with the number of individuals supporting the new activity. Here, we investigated how meerkats (Suricata suricatta) use vocalizations in the context of movement decisions. Moving calls emitted by meerkats increased the speed of the group, with a sharp increase in the probability of changing foraging patch when the number of group members joining the chorus increased from two up to three. These calls had no apparent effect on the group's movement direction. When dominant individuals were involved in the chorus, the group's reaction was not stronger than when only subordinates called. Groups only increased speed in response to playbacks of moving calls from one individual when other group members emitted moving calls as well. The voting mechanism linked to a quorum probably allows meerkat groups to change foraging patches cohesively with increased speed. Such vocal coordination may reflect an aggregation rule linking individual assessment of foraging patch quality to group travel route.",0.006662793,0.007899829,0.018965852,0.046619993,0.004288269,0.004554767,0.003585503,0.009993359,0.014420509,0.012588445,0.006386284,0.010092512,0.011245579,0.02047279,0.005381318,0.006213261,0.01032864,0.012656814,0.012320355,0.005088805,0.003578093,0.5583489,0.010122453,0.014671801,0.005925469,0.009990769,0.004191991,0.003803215,0.007984973,"['bird', 'birds']","[0.020408163265306003, 0.020408163265306003]","[1.0, 1.0]"

These effects result from a voltage sensor trapping mechanism, in which toxins trap the voltage sensor in its activated conformation. Determinants of β-scorpion toxin (CssIV) binding and action on sodium channel (Nav1.2) are located in the S1-S2 and S3-S4 extracellular linkers in the voltage-sensing module in domain II. To completely map these regions, we made substitutions for previously unstudied amino acid residues and examined modulation by CssIVE15A, a highly active toxin derivative. Of 11 positions studied in IIS1-S2, only one significantly altered the toxin effect from wild-type by reducing binding to the resting state and almost abolishing trapping activity. In IIS3-S4, five positions surrounding a previously identified key binding determinant, G845, define a hotspot of high impact residues. Three of these substitutions reduced toxin binding and voltage-sensor trapping. The other two, V843A and E844N, increased voltage-sensor trapping approximately 4-fold and decreased apparent EC50. The rate of voltage sensor trapping upon depolarization was unchanged for V843A and increased approximately 2.5-fold for E844N. The rate at which the toxin releases the voltage sensor upon repolarization was increased 2.2-fold for the V843A but was unchanged for E844N. Thus CssIVE15A interacts with a short segment of IIS1-S2 and a broader region of DIIS3-S4. The bidirectional effects of mutations on toxin efficacy suggest that native residues make both positive and negative interactions with the toxin. Substitutions that increase toxin effects do so by increasing affinity of resting channels for the toxin and further increasing the relative affinity of the activated voltage-sensor for the toxin. These results provide further support for the voltage sensor-trapping model.",0.032512274,0.013954176,0.33287674,0.017809452,0.034040764,0.006757383,0.013690135,0.0157518,0.05937756,0.012176175,0.013963862,0.01722292,0.010957097,0.012127902,0.00559338,0.007120835,0.028338045,0.008760522,0.027474444,0.007405275,0.01113635,0.5218976,0.01687078,0.00964603,0.009731756,0.009959544,0.0076008,0.004769219,0.014253854,"['strongylocentrotus purpuratus', 'purple sea urchin', 'sea urchin']","[0.014705882352941001, 0.0, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

Numerous theoretical models have shown that competing species can coexist if ecological processes such as dispersal, movement, and interaction occur over small spatial scales. In particular, this may be the case for non-transitive communities, that is, those without strict competitive hierarchies. The classic non-transitive system involves a community of three competing species satisfying a relationship similar to the children's game rock–paper–scissors, where rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock. Such relationships have been demonstrated in several natural systems. Some models predict that local interaction and dispersal are sufficient to ensure coexistence of all three species in such a community, whereas diversity is lost when ecological processes occur over larger scales. Here, we test these predictions empirically using a non-transitive model community containing three populations of Escherichia coli.

Here, we use single-cell tracking and dynamical modeling to develop and validate a revised model for lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced macrophage activation that invokes a mechanism we term quorum licensing. The results show that bimodal phenotypic partitioning of macrophages is primed during the resting state, dependent on cumulative history of cell density, predicted by extrinsic noise in transcription factor expression, and independent of canonical LPS-induced intercellular feedback in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) response. Our analysis shows how this density-dependent coupling produces a nonlinear effect on collective TNF production. We speculate that by linking macrophage density to activation, this mechanism could amplify local responses to threats and prevent false alarms.

It has been hypothesized that ""common mycorrhizal networks,"" wherein roots of seedlings are linked to overstory trees by symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi, offset some or all of the negative effects of trees on seedlings. Here we report the results of an unambiguous experimental test of this hypothesis in a monodominant Pinus radiata forest. We also tested the hypothesis that adaptive differentiation among plant populations causes local plant genotypes to respond more positively to mycorrhizal networks than nonlocal plant genotypes. Our results demonstrate large positive effects of overstory mycorrhizal networks on seedling survival, along with simultaneous negative effects of tree roots, regardless of whether plant genotypes were locally derived. Physiological and leaf-chemistry measurements suggest that seedlings connected to common mycorrhizal networks benefited from increased access to soil water. The similar magnitude of the positive and negative overstory effects on seedlings and the ubiquity of mycorrhizal networks in forests suggest that mycorrhizal networks fundamentally influence the demographic and community dynamics of forest trees.",0.15604106,0.007696037,0.014760367,0.029341046,0.010667532,0.004208398,0.004509998,0.007187031,0.004937892,0.007064735,0.01347912,0.013484073,0.007942787,0.14619033,0.007398229,0.00506075,0.009795496,0.012820726,0.30012465,0.00610036,0.009376893,0.06291291,0.009052744,0.009619387,0.008124798,0.016066132,0.005872316,0.005615884,0.00780467,[],[],[]

These toxins are also ichthyotoxic. Freshwater and marine fish exposed to toxin concentrations of 0.5 micrograms/ml water were killed within 2 hr and exhibited extensive pathological alterations of the gill filaments. Amphiprion species, e.g. clarkii and percula, which live in the sea anemones Heteractis crispa and Stichodactyla mertensii, were highly vulnerable to the Heteractis magnifica toxin, whereas A. percula from the sea anemone H. magnifica proved to be toxin resistant. However, another species, A. perideraion also living in H. magnifica, was highly sensitive to the toxin. The two toxins exhibited cross-reactivity: Amphiprion, resistant to H. magnifica toxin, was also resistant to Entacmaea quadricolor toxin; but all fish were killed by other membrane-active substances such as gramicidin, saponin and latrunculin. The results of the study indicate that resistance to toxins secreted by the sea anemone has evolved in some Amphiprion species, but it is not an essential or a major factor in the anemonefish symbiosis.

This biological coating contains chromophores that absorb UV radiation in such a way that it removes the most harmful UV-B and UV-A from the solar spectrum received by the plant and does not lower the received PAR (photosynthetically active radiation). In addition, the P. mugo grown at high elevations in the Alps has a cuticular wax coat that also contains fluorsphores, which convert the harmful solar UV into blue light.

As seen in marine teleosts, luminal HCO3- concentrations were 10-fold plasma levels in all species when exposed to hyperosmotic conditions. While intestinal water absorption left Mg2+ and SO4(2-) concentrated in intestinal fluids up to four-fold ambient seawater concentrations, HCO3- was concentrated up to 50 times ambient levels as a result of intestinal HCO3- secretion. Reduced luminal Cl- concentrations in the intestine of all species suggest that HCO3- secretion also occurs via Cl-/HCO3- exchange in chondrostean and chondrichthyan fishes. Sturgeon began precipitating carbonates from the gut after only 3 days at 14 per thousand, a mechanism utilized by marine teleosts to reduce intestinal fluid osmolality and maintain calcium homeostasis. Analysis of published intestinal fluid composition in the cyclostome Lampetra fluviatilis reveals that this species likely also utilize intestinal HCO3- secretion for osmoregulation.

The resulting catalog of behaviors includes two principal categories: Swim­ ming/lunging behaviors and bubbling behaviors. A behavior from a given category may be used independently or in association with others, and by individual or groups of humpbacks. The first category includes surface lunging, circular swimming/thrashing, and the ""inside loop"" behavior. In the second category, a wide variety of feeding-associated bubbling behaviors are described, some for the first time. The structures formed by underwater exhalations are of two major types: 1) bubble cloud-a single, relatively large (4-7m diameter), dome-shaped cloud formed of small, uniformly sized bubbles; and 2) bubble column-a smaller (1-1.5 m diameter) structure composed of larger, randomly sized bubbles, used in series or multiples. Both basic structures are employed in a variety of ways. Many of these behaviors are believed to be utilized to maintain naturally occurring concentrations of prey, which have been identified as the American sand lance, Ammodytes americanus, and occasionally as herring, Clupea harengus.

Energy budgets have been constructed in two different ways for each jump, and the total energy involved in each case was estimated to lie between 1–6 × 10−4 J and 3–8 × 10−4 J. Power output during the jumping action (a “catapult”) lay between 80 × 103 W/kg muscle and 180 × 103 W/kg muscle, whilst power output during the energy storing pre-jump period (of about 0–4 s) was at least 130 W/kg muscle (at over 25°C).

However, in this environment, where the light field is directional (and thus likely to cause reflections), and under the bioluminescent searchlights of potential predators, animals may be revealed by reflections from their body surface [4-7]. We investigated the cuticle surfaces of seven species of hyperiids (Crustacea; Amphipoda) using scanning electron microscopy and found two undocumented features that may reduce reflectance. We found that the legs of Cystisoma spp. (n = 5) are covered with an ordered array of nanoprotuberances 200 ± 20 nm SD in height that function optically as a gradient refractive index material [6, 8, 9]. Additionally, we observed that Cystisoma and six other species of hyperiids are covered with a monolayer of homogenous spheres (diameters ranging from 52 ± 7 nm SD on Cystisoma spp. to 320 ± 15 nm SD on Phronima spp.). Optical modeling using effective medium theory and transfer matrix methods demonstrated that both the nanoprotuberances and the monolayers reduce reflectance by as much as 100-fold, depending on the wavelength and angle of the incident light and the thickness of the gradient layer. Even though we only consider surface reflectance and not internal light scattering, our study demonstrates that these nanoprotuberances and spheres can improve crypsis in a featureless habitat where the smallest reflection can render an animal vulnerable to visual predation.",0.010850777,0.56198835,0.006534359,0.008062495,0.006730878,0.0099004,0.006206378,0.008193112,0.007357696,0.007237713,0.003823325,0.004618523,0.007282435,0.00658905,0.007913552,0.00441054,0.006170363,0.06825255,0.00696249,0.01025241,0.00937855,0.010965192,0.039141648,0.00675634,0.006628215,0.007296793,0.009552458,0.01159851,0.009156323,"['bacteria', 'eleftheria terrae', 'staphylococcus aureus']","[0.013333333333333001, 0.006666666666666, 0.013333333333333001]","[1.0, 0.5, 1.0]"

Our previous studies showed, repeatedly, the consistent antimicrobial activity of F. vesiculosus crude extracts against human pathogens, while untargeted metabolomics analyses have revealed a variety of metabolites. In this study, we applied the UPLC-QToF-MS/MS-based “bioactive molecular networking” (BMN) concept on the most bioactive n-hexane and n-butanol subextracts of Baltic F. vesiculosus coupled with in silico dereplication tools to identify the compounds responsible for antimicrobial activity. The first antimicrobial cluster identified by BMN was galactolipids. Our targeted isolation efforts for this class led to the isolation of six monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) derivatives (1–6) and one digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG, 7).

In particular, phlorethol-type phlorotannins showed high correlations with antimicrobial activity based on the BMN approach, and two phlorotannins (8–9) were isolated.

In the light of this, some species have evolved a seemingly illogical strategy: they reduce the size of the brain and several organs to become even smaller in winter. To test how this morphological strategy affects energy consumption across seasonally shifting ambient temperatures, we measured oxygen consumption and behaviour in the three seasonal phenotypes of the common shrew (Sorex araneus), which differ in size by about 20%. Body mass was the main driver of oxygen consumption, not the reduction of metabolically expensive brain mass. Against our expectations, we found no change in relative oxygen consumption with low ambient temperature. Thus, smaller body size in winter resulted in significant absolute energy savings. This finding could only partly be explained by an increase of lower cost behaviours in the activity budgets. Our findings highlight that these shrews manage to avoid one of the most fundamental and intuitive rules of ecology, allowing them to subsist with lower resource availability and successfully survive the harsh conditions of winter.",0.008073852,0.004983426,0.008734235,0.003101761,0.007883928,0.007513251,0.008163516,0.004669402,0.010878341,0.004428637,0.010736647,0.006822782,0.004591599,0.003846565,0.003013186,0.04263198,0.004442252,0.006312175,0.006329792,0.006757284,0.009260953,0.005414568,0.8705355,0.003713738,0.007311335,0.005211239,0.00489172,0.008953165,0.017059688,[],[],[]

In addition to walking as most insects do, nearly all the species of flea beetles have an ability to jump and this ability is commonly understood as one of the key adaptations responsible for its diversity. Our investigation of flea beetle jumping is based on high-speed filming, micro-CT scans and 3D reconstructions, and provides a mechanical description of the jump. We reveal that the flea beetle jumping mechanism is a catapult in nature and is enabled by a small structure in the hind femur called an 'elastic plate' which powers the explosive jump and protects other structures from potential injury. The explosive catapult jump of flea beetles involves a unique 'high-efficiency mechanism' and 'positive feedback mechanism'.

This consumption, also observed in a related lepidopteran species, is stimulated by the sugar alcohol mannitol, found in much higher concentration in fungal tissue and infected leaves than uninfected plant foliage. Gypsy moth larvae developed more rapidly on rust-infected leaves, which cannot be attributed to mannitol but rather to greater levels of total nitrogen, essential amino acids and B vitamins in fungal tissue and fungus-infected leaves.

In the model organism Carausius morosus, the main tactile sensory organs are long, thin, seemingly delicate, but very robust antennae. Previous studies have shown that these antennae are compliant under contact, yet stiff enough to maintain a straight shape during active exploration. Overcritical damping of the flagellum, on the other hand, allows for a rapid return to the straight shape after release of contact. Which roles do the morphological and biomechanical adaptations of the flagellum play in determining these special mechanical properties? To investigate this question, we used a combination of biomechanical experiments and numerical modelling. A set of four finite-element (FE) model variants was derived to investigate the effect of the distinct geometrical and material properties of the flagellum on its static (bending) and dynamic (damping) characteristics. The results of our numerical simulations show that the tapered shape of the flagellum had the strongest influence on its static biomechanical behaviour. The annulated structure and thickness gradient affected the deformability of the flagellum to a lesser degree. The inner endocuticle layer of the flagellum was confirmed to be essential for explaining the strongly damped return behaviour of the antenna. By highlighting the significance of two out of the four main structural features of the insect flagellum, our study provides a basis for mechanical design of biomimetic touch sensors tuned to become maximally flexible while quickly resuming a straight shape after contact.",0.004837723,0.005672554,0.009814668,0.006396126,0.015464069,0.10848437,0.004356833,0.005827038,0.029032437,0.38414338,0.003811127,0.004325132,0.004702946,0.005025669,0.013335226,0.003396364,0.012113047,0.006259023,0.004623359,0.008086777,0.007856773,0.01766172,0.007998918,0.013561538,0.0056323,0.004277748,0.006848365,0.008068004,0.035512183,"['bacteria', 'streptococcus mutans']","[0.014285714285714, 0.014285714285714]","[1.0, 1.0]"

Carnivorous pitcher plants (CPPs) use cone-shaped leaves to trap animals for nutrient supply but are not able to kill all intruders of their traps. Numerous species, ranging from bacteria to vertrebrates, survive and propagate in the otherwise deadly traps. This paper reviews the literature on phytotelmata of CPPs.


PITCHER
Fluid as a Habitat The volumes of pitchers range from 0·2 mL to 1·5 L. In Nepenthes and Cephalotus, the fluid is secreted by the trap; the other genera collect rain water. The fluid is usually acidic, rich in O(2) and contains digestive enzymes. In some taxa, toxins or detergents are found, or the fluid is extremely viscous. In Heliamphora or Sarracenia, the fluid differs little from pure water.


INQUILINE
Diversity Pitcher inquilines comprise bacteria, protozoa, algae, fungi, rotifers, crustaceans, arachnids, insects and amphibia. The dominant groups are protists and Dipteran larvae. The various species of CPPs host different sets of inquilines. Sarracenia purpurea hosts up to 165 species of inquilines, followed by Nepenthes ampullaria with 59 species, compared with only three species from Brocchinia reducta. Reasons for these differences include size, the life span of the pitcher as well as its fluid. MUTUALISTIC: Activities Inquilines closely interact with their host. Some live as parasites, but the vast majority are mutualists. Beneficial activities include secretion of enzymes, feeding on the plant's prey and successive excretion of inorganic nutrients, mechanical break up of the prey, removal of excessive prey and assimilation of atmospheric N(2).


CONCLUSIONS
There is strong evidence that CPPs influence their phytotelm. Two strategies can be distinguished: (1) Nepenthes and Cephalotus produce acidic, toxic or digestive fluids and host a limited diversity of inquilines. (2) Genera without efficient enzymes such as Sarracenia or Heliamphora host diverse organisms and depend to a large extent on their symbionts for prey utilization.",0.044460494,0.002590765,0.003793009,0.016990295,0.002891762,0.002589762,0.001430018,0.003492412,0.002038533,0.016024146,0.008619299,0.005014715,0.007169948,0.018720353,0.008438934,0.002260652,0.002630248,0.008158938,0.02885841,0.003434463,0.003984907,0.005259328,0.003067382,0.008339047,0.003371735,0.008796301,0.002400693,0.007432853,0.00480172,"['zebrafish', 'fishes']","[0.012345679012345002, 0.012345679012345002]","[1.0, 1.0]"

In particular, significant effort is underway to understand the insect wing surface structure to establish rational design tools for the development of novel engineered materials. Most studies, however, have focused on superhydrophobic wings obtained from a single insect species, in particular, the Psaltoda claripennis cicada. Here, we investigate the relationship between the spatially dependent wing wettability, topology, and droplet jumping behavior of multiple cicada species and their habitat, lifecycle, and interspecies relatedness. We focus on cicada wings of four different species: Neotibicen pruinosus, N. tibicen, Megatibicen dorsatus, and Magicicada septendecim and take a comparative approach. Using spatially resolved microgoniometry, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and high speed optical microscopy, we show that within cicada species, the wettability of wings is spatially homogeneous across wing cells. All four species were shown to have truncated conical pillars with widely varying length scales ranging from 50 to 400 nm in height. Comparison of the wettability revealed three cicada species with wings that are superhydrophobic (>150°) with low contact angle hysteresis (<5°), resulting in stable droplet jumping behavior. The fourth, more distantly related species (Ma. septendecim) showed only moderate hydrophobic behavior, eliminating some of the beneficial surface functional aspects for this cicada. Correlation between cicada habitat and wing wettability yielded little connection as wetter, swampy environments do not necessarily equate to higher measured wing hydrophobicity. The results, however, do point to species relatedness and reproductive strategy as a closer proxy for predicting wettability and surface structure and resultant enhanced wing surface functionality. This work not only elucidates the differences between inter- and intraspecies cicada wing topology, wettability, and water shedding behavior but also enables the development of rational design tools for the manufacture of artificial surfaces for energy and water applications.",0.005182768,0.005839535,0.007259904,0.004419043,0.027380254,0.00429798,0.01180211,0.008138354,0.018207567,0.010163391,0.005800315,0.008908534,0.013178379,0.005780249,0.00485205,0.034478143,0.019702876,0.009139173,0.012819706,0.008629109,0.013115956,0.002934636,0.021315614,0.004990134,0.008982979,0.012362947,0.023541415,0.52728575,0.008200353,"['tree frogs', 'smilisca sila', 'bats', 'frogs']","[0.0, 0.0, 0.022222222222222, 0.022222222222222]","[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0]"

In many insects, different orientations of photonic crystal domains are used to create various hues.

We found that C. jejuni coordinates its dual flagella by wrapping the leading filament around the cell body during swimming in high-viscosity media and that its differentiated flagellar filament and helical body have evolved to facilitate this wrapped-mode swimming.",0.018906025,0.007920567,0.011198076,0.020294562,0.012779379,0.29589415,0.005167766,0.010256746,0.026260898,0.7788871,0.017569894,0.015443456,0.008757952,0.007474222,0.022081949,0.005105204,0.005254152,0.007617748,0.011362571,0.040047616,0.011228201,0.009799036,0.015838299,0.018356431,0.010028699,0.039499503,0.007982216,0.018661147,0.0447195,"['crassa', 'neurospora crassa']","[0.03076923076923, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0]"

However, little is known about the critical mechanisms by which fibroblasts adapt themselves and their microenvironment in the earliest stage of cell-matrix interaction. Here, we identified the mechanisms by which fibroblasts interact with their 3D collagen fibrous matrices in the early stages of cell-matrix interaction and showed that fibroblasts use energetically efficient hierarchical micro/nano scaled protrusions in these stages as the primary means for the transformation and adaptation. We found that actomyosin contractility in these protrusions in the early stages of cell-matrix interaction restricts the growth of microtubules by applying compressive forces on them. Our results show that actomyosin contractility and microtubules work in concert in the early stages of cell-matrix interaction to adapt fibroblasts and their microenvironment to one another. These early-stage interactions result in responses to disruption of the microtubule network and/or actomyosin contractility that are opposite to well-known responses to late-stage disruption, and reveal insight into the ways that cells adapt themselves and their ECM recursively.",0.007670973,0.006110215,0.1790492,0.005812758,0.42919347,0.018284425,0.118406154,0.19329998,0.14845493,0.072501354,0.006814508,0.06103671,0.010309341,0.013783614,0.11405219,0.014531099,0.032313626,0.010379004,0.02500215,0.014284298,0.09503969,0.010512745,0.014574057,0.5013633,0.017767478,0.013812522,0.020197993,0.052194837,0.21804655,[],[],[]

A few studies reported the biodegradation of PS, but most of them merely observed its weight loss; fewer were able to find its chemical modifications, which are rather direct evidence of biodegradation, by using limited organisms. Therefore, it is required to find an effective way to decompose PS using various kinds of organisms. Herein, we discovered a new PS-degrading insect species and bacterial strain, and we found that the genus that includes the PS-degrading bacterial strain occurs in significant amounts in the larval gut flora, and the proportion of this genus increased as the larvae were fed Styrofoam. Our research offers a wider selection of PS-degrading insects and the possibility of using a certain mixture of bacteria that resemble the gut flora of a PS-degrading insect to biodegrade PS, and thus could contribute to solving the global plastic crisis. ABSTRACT Polystyrene (PS), which accounts for a significant fraction of plastic wastes, is difficult to biodegrade due to its unique molecular structure. Therefore, biodegradation and chemical modification of PS are limited. In this study, we report PS biodegradation by the larvae of the darkling beetle Plesiophthalmus davidis (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae). In 14 days, P. davidis ingested 34.27 ± 4.04 mg of Styrofoam (PS foam) per larva and survived by feeding only on Styrofoam. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed that the ingested Styrofoam was oxidized. Gel permeation chromatography analysis indicated the decrease in average molecular weight of the residual PS in the frass compared with the feed Styrofoam. When the extracted gut flora was cultured for 20 days with PS films, biofilm and cavities were observed by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies revealed that C-O bonding was introduced into the biodegraded PS film. Serratia sp. strain WSW (KCTC 82146), which was isolated from the gut flora, also formed a biofilm and cavities on the PS film in 20 days, but its degradation was less prominent than the gut flora. XPS confirmed that C-O and C=O bonds were introduced into the biodegraded PS film by Serratia sp. WSW. Microbial community analysis revealed that Serratia was in the gut flora in significant amounts and increased sixfold when the larvae were fed Styrofoam for 2 weeks. This suggests that P. davidis larvae and its gut bacteria could be used to chemically modify and rapidly degrade PS. IMPORTANCE PS is widely produced in the modern world, but it is robust against biodegradation.

Alcids exhibit exceptional dive performance while retaining aerial flight.

We show that alcids cruise at Strouhal numbers between 0.10 and 0.40 – on par with single-fluid specialists – in both air and water but flap their wings ~ 50% slower in water. Thus, these species either contract their muscles at inefficient velocities or maintain a two-geared muscle system, highlighting a clear cost to using the same morphology for locomotion in two fluids.

Here we present the binding mode of teixobactins in cellular membranes using solid-state NMR, microscopy, and affinity assays. We solve the structure of the complex formed by an improved teixobactin-analogue and Lipid II and reveal how teixobactins recognize a broad spectrum of targets. Unexpectedly, we find that teixobactins only weakly bind to Lipid II in cellular membranes, implying the direct interaction with cell wall precursors is not the sole killing mechanism.

However, given their small thermal capacity, wings can overheat rapidly in the sun. Here we analyze butterfly wings across a wide range of simulated environmental conditions, and find that regions containing living cells are maintained at cooler temperatures. Diverse scale nanostructures and non-uniform cuticle thicknesses create a heterogeneous distribution of radiative cooling that selectively reduces the temperature of structures such as wing veins and androconial organs. These tissues are supplied by circulatory, neural and tracheal systems throughout the adult lifetime, indicating that the insect wing is a dynamic, living structure. Behavioral assays show that butterflies use wings to sense visible and infrared radiation, responding with specialized behaviors to prevent overheating of their wings. Our work highlights the physiological importance of wing temperature and how it is exquisitely regulated by structural and behavioral adaptations.

The tooth is formed continuously at one end, while it grinds and wears at the opposite end, the sharp tip. Remarkably, these teeth enable the sea urchin to scrape and bore holes into rock, yet the teeth remain sharp rather than dull with use. Here we describe the detailed structure of the tooth of the California purple sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, and focus on the self-sharpening mechanism. Using high-resolution X-ray photoelectron emission spectromicroscopy (X-PEEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), EDX analysis, nanoindentation, and X-ray micro-tomography, we deduce that the sea urchin tooth self-sharpens by fracturing at discontinuities in the material. These are organic layers surrounding plates and fibers that behave as the “fault lines” in the tooth structure, as shown by nanoindentation. Shedding of tooth components at these discontinuities exposes the robust central part of the tooth, aptly termed “the stone”, which becomes the grinding tip. The precise design and position of the plates and fibers determines the profile of the tooth tip, so as the tooth wears it maintains a tip that is continually renewed and remains sharp.

 Summary
 
 Ebola virus (EBOV) causes a severe, often fatal disease in humans and nonhuman primates. Within the past decade, EBOV has caused two large and difficult-to-control outbreaks, one of which recently ended in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Bats are the likely reservoir of EBOV, but little is known of their relationship with the virus. We perform serial passages of EBOV in human and bat cells and use circular sequencing to compare the short-term evolution of the virus. Virus populations passaged in bat cells have sequence markers indicative of host RNA editing enzyme activity, including evidence for ADAR editing of the EBOV glycoprotein. Multiple regions in the EBOV genome appear to have undergone adaptive evolution when passaged in bat and human cells. Individual mutated viruses are rescued and characterized. Our results provide insight into the host species-specific evolution of EBOV and highlight the adaptive flexibility of the virus.

As hypercapnia is known to suppress neuronal activity, we studied whether naked mole-rats might demonstrate energy savings in GABAergic inhibition. Using whole-colony behavioral monitoring of captive naked mole-rats, we found a durable nest, characterized by high CO2 levels, where all colony members spent the majority of their time. Analysis of the naked mole-rat genome revealed, uniquely among mammals, a histidine point variation in the neuronal potassium-chloride cotransporter 2 (KCC2). A histidine missense substitution mutation at this locus in the human ortholog of KCC2, found previously in patients with febrile seizures and epilepsy, has been demonstrated to diminish neuronal Cl- extrusion capacity, and thus impairs GABAergic inhibition. Seizures were observed, without pharmacological intervention, in adult naked mole-rats exposed to a simulated hyperthermic surface environment, causing systemic hypocapnic alkalosis. Consistent with the diminished function of KCC2, adult naked mole-rats demonstrate a reduced efficacy of inhibition that manifests as triggering of seizures at room temperature by the GABAA receptor (GABAAR) positive allosteric modulator diazepam. These seizures are blocked in the presence of nest-like levels of CO2 and likely to be mediated through GABAAR activity, based on in vitro recordings. Thus, altered GABAergic inhibition adds to a growing list of adaptations in the naked mole-rat and provides a plausible proximate mechanism for nesting behavior, where a return to the colony nest restores GABA-mediated inhibition.",0.006040078,0.005758322,0.00851051,0.006994128,0.003635304,0.004376255,0.004396365,0.005123386,0.00978505,0.004301291,0.016544532,0.012907337,0.00429421,0.003430075,0.002839963,0.040763754,0.004220729,0.004395862,0.005307694,0.005589429,0.003674564,0.019811245,0.70580196,0.005226838,0.00607401,0.00454362,0.002773543,0.006536957,0.006340718,"['moths', 'bats', 'butterflies']","[0.09090909090909001, 0.025974025974025, 0.012987012987012]","[1.0, 0.28571428571428503, 0.14285714285714202]"

For evolutionary biologists the question is often how group behaviors such as collective action, or decision making that accounts for memories of past experience, can emerge and persist in an evolving system. Evolutionary game theory provides a framework for formalizing these questions and admitting them to rigorous study. Here we develop such a framework to study the evolution of sustained collective action in multi-player public-goods games, in which players have arbitrarily long memories of prior rounds of play and can react to their experience in an arbitrary way. We construct a coordinate system for memory-m strategies in iterated n-player games that permits us to characterize all cooperative strategies that resist invasion by any mutant strategy, and stabilize cooperative behavior. We show that, especially when groups are small, longer-memory strategies make cooperation easier to evolve, by increasing the number of ways to stabilize cooperation. We also explore the co-evolution of behavior and memory. We find that even when memory has a cost, longer-memory strategies often evolve, which in turn drives the evolution of cooperation, even when the benefits for cooperation are low.",0.006921256,0.00683623,0.019222645,0.025229685,0.011058844,0.005566617,0.00636002,0.009647993,0.010460223,0.01872256,0.011190418,0.02622501,0.011381995,0.015984077,0.011975584,0.010458398,0.021881655,0.013407607,0.0101942,0.00780809,0.004763584,0.7320275,0.008582881,0.04001619,0.008717947,0.027069172,0.005741752,0.002725312,0.011996624,['photorhabdus luminescens'],[0.017543859649122],[1.0]

Applying high-porosity microarchitectured materials to durable devices, such as vehicles, however, will require the materials to also resist failure during cyclic loading. Here, we identify an aspect of microstructure in cancellous bone that greatly influences failure under cyclic loading and show that the effect is generalizable to synthetic microarchitectured materials. Our findings demonstrate that a common design strategy to improve stiffness and strength of microarchitectured materials comes at the cost of impaired service life. Our findings are useful for the design and application of microarchitectured materials and additionally provide insight into human health in situations of osteoporosis. Microarchitectured materials achieve superior mechanical properties through geometry rather than composition. Although ultralightweight microarchitectured materials can have high stiffness and strength, application to durable devices will require sufficient service life under cyclic loading. Naturally occurring materials provide useful models for high-performance materials. Here, we show that in cancellous bone, a naturally occurring lightweight microarchitectured material, resistance to fatigue failure is sensitive to a microarchitectural trait that has negligible effects on stiffness and strength—the proportion of material oriented transverse to applied loads. Using models generated with additive manufacturing, we show that small increases in the thickness of elements oriented transverse to loading can increase fatigue life by 10 to 100 times, far exceeding what is expected from the associated change in density. Transversely oriented struts enhance resistance to fatigue by acting as sacrificial elements. We show that this mechanism is also present in synthetic microlattice structures, where fatigue life can be altered by 5 to 9 times with only negligible changes in density and stiffness. The effects of microstructure on fatigue life in cancellous bone and lattice structures are described empirically by normalizing stress in traditional stress vs. life (S-N) curves by √ψ, where ψ is the proportion of material oriented transverse to load. The mechanical performance of cancellous bone and microarchitectured materials is enhanced by aligning structural elements with expected loading; our findings demonstrate that this strategy comes at the cost of reduced fatigue life, with consequences to the use of microarchitectured materials in durable devices and to human health in the context of osteoporosis.",0.012157869,0.008820405,0.018708164,0.009201424,0.62417746,0.012514826,0.035284713,0.017370448,0.008190106,0.01903907,0.01115911,0.009416129,0.017471863,0.013456091,0.01006911,0.012009506,0.029913208,0.013978945,0.011959999,0.012024961,0.027160084,0.008604151,0.015149513,0.016183637,0.8735205,0.017021988,0.05702875,0.015390654,0.013593354,[],[],[]

Bacteria, algae and invertebrates grow on these surfaces (fouling) and change the surface properties of the primary substrate, and therefore the attachment conditions for benthic organisms. In this study, we investigate the influence of fouling and surface roughness on the adhesive strength of northern clingfish, Gobiesox maeandricus. We measured clingfish tenacity on unfouled and fouled substrates over four surface roughnesses. We exposed surfaces for 6 weeks in the Pacific Ocean, until they were covered with periphyton. Clingfish tenacity is equivalent on both fouled and unfouled smooth substrates; however, tenacity on fouled rough surfaces is less compared with tenacity on unfouled ones. We hypothesize that parts of biofilm may act as a lubricant and decrease friction of the disc margin, thereby making disc margins slip inwards and fail at lower tenacities. Nevertheless, even on fouled surfaces the adhesive forces are approximately 150 times the body weight of the fish. To identify the upper threshold of surface roughness the fish can cling to, we tested seven unfouled substrates of increasing surface roughness. The threshold roughness at which northern clingfish failed increased with specimen size. We hypothesize that because of the elastic properties of the disc margin, a larger disc can adapt to larger surface irregularities. The largest specimens (length 10–12 cm) were able to cling to surfaces with 2–4 mm grain size. The fish can attach to surfaces with roughness between 2 and 9% of the suction disc width.",0.021154663,0.006491335,0.01046838,0.010464296,0.00897809,0.014151122,0.004136323,0.006772259,0.009875542,0.91415757,0.006335115,0.010428603,0.008069996,0.010636813,0.04361293,0.005287969,0.004931327,0.008700512,0.017236104,0.011633585,0.004840926,0.008233613,0.005627212,0.011735157,0.008635442,0.010572274,0.00981736,0.027763832,0.016008027,['cyanobacteria'],[0.022222222222222],[1.0]

These material systems smartly control the addition/removal of material in locations of high/low mechanical stress by utilizing local resources guided by biological signals. On the contrary, synthetic structural materials have unchanging mechanical properties limiting their mechanical performance and service life. Inspired by the mineralization process of bone, a material system that adapts its mechanical properties in response to external mechanical loading is reported. It is found that charges from piezoelectric scaffolds can induce mineralization from surrounding media. It is shown that the material system can adapt to external mechanical loading by inducing mineral deposition in proportion to the magnitude of the stress and the resulting piezoelectric charges. Moreover, the mineralization mechanism allows a simple one-step route for fabricating functionally graded materials by controlling the stress distribution along the scaffold. The findings can pave the way for a new class of self-regenerating materials that reinforce regions of high stress or induce deposition of minerals on the damaged areas from the increase in mechanical stress to prevent/mitigate failure.

We studied flood dynamics created by American beaver (C. canadensis K.) in a southern boreal landscape in Finland in 1970-2018. We present for the first time, to our knowledge, a temporally continuous long-term study of beaver-induced flood disturbances starting from the appearance of beaver in the area. During the 49 years, the emergence of new sites flooded by beaver and repeated floods (61% of the sites) formed a dynamic mosaic characterized by clustered patterns of beaver sites. As beaver dispersal proceeded, connectivity of beaver sites increased significantly. The mean flood duration was approximately three years, which highlights the importance of datasets with high-temporal resolution in detecting beaver-induced disturbances. An individual site was often part of the active flood mosaic over several decades, although the duration and the number of repeated floods at different sites varied considerably. Variation of flood-inundated and post-flood phases at individual sites resulted in a cumulative number of unique patches that contribute to environmental heterogeneity in space and time. A disturbance mosaic consisting of patches differing by successional age and flood history is likely to support species richness and abundance of different taxa and facilitate whole species communities.

Consistent with this prediction, imaging analysis show that CXCL13 binds to extracellular matrix components in situ, constraining its diffusion. CXCL13 solubilization requires the protease cathepsin B that cleaves CXCL13 into a stable product. Mice lacking cathepsin B display aberrant follicular architecture, a phenotype associated with effective B cell homing to but not within lymph nodes.

Finding a mate can thus be difficult. In response to this situation, one group of deep-sea denizens, the anglerfishes, have evolved a system in which males attach to females, in some cases permanently, through fusion of tissues and connection of circulatory systems. Such attachment greatly challenges the immune systems of the fish. Swann et al. found that these challenges have been met by the evolution of increasingly reduced immune responses among anglerfish species, including the loss of what have been considered essential vertebrate responses. These shifts suggest that vertebrate immune systems may be more flexible over evolutionary time than was previously thought. Science, this issue p. 1608 Anglerfish display altered immune responses to accommodate an unusual male attachment reproductive strategy. Sexual parasitism has evolved as a distinctive mode of reproduction among deep-sea anglerfishes. The permanent attachment of males to host females observed in these species represents a form of anatomical joining, which is otherwise unknown in nature. Pronounced modifications to immune facilities are associated with this reproductive trait. The genomes of species with temporarily attaching males lack functional aicda genes that underpin affinity maturation of antibodies. Permanent attachment is associated with additional alterations, culminating in the loss of functional rag genes in some species, abolishing somatic diversification of antigen receptor genes, the hallmark of canonical adaptive immunity. In anglerfishes, coevolution of innate and adaptive immunity has been disentangled, implying that an alternative form of immunity supported the emergence of this evolutionarily successful group of vertebrates.",0.006508505,0.004560417,0.006132263,0.009546599,0.004901439,0.003811305,0.003663703,0.002770767,0.009423898,0.048428122,0.012060517,0.012047308,0.003564202,0.00482536,0.04251796,0.006738654,0.002634914,0.004753,0.005724761,0.004179937,0.004181348,0.018864185,0.004550125,0.019022409,0.003107413,0.22912131,0.002505274,0.005849002,0.002387232,"['gasterosteus aculeatus', 'fish', 'sticklebacks', 'three-spined stickleback']","[0.0, 0.023809523809523003, 0.023809523809523003, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0]"

Captive birds provide a useful model for investigating aspects of social choice in highly gregarious, long-lived species. Animals invest in social relationships that convey fitness benefits and bonds can be long-lasting. For some species, field-based measurement of social networks can be difficult. Captive populations therefore provide a useful alternative for measuring social choices. Data were collected on flamingos at WWT Slimbridge Wetland Centre from 2013 to 2016 and compared to data from 2012. For three flocks, associations were analysed along with individual foot health scores to identify any relationship between health and social behaviour. Long-term partnerships were present in all flocks; preferred associates noted in 2012 were present in 2016. Matrix correlations across years were positive; arrangements of dyads, trios and quartets with higher ties strengths were visible at the beginning and end of the study. Both male-male and female-female bonds were stable over time. All flamingos were more frequently seen socialising than solitary; those in the largest flock showed the highest occurrence of social behaviour (irrespective of enclosure size differences). The number of connections realised from all available within a network was significantly influenced by season. Foot health did not predict associations in these three flamingo networks. Our results indicate that flamingo societies are complex (i.e. formed of long-standing preferential partnerships and not loose, random connections) and the impact of flock size and environment on sociality should be investigated further. These results are helpful for those working with captive flamingos to consider the number of birds housed so that an array of opportunities for choice of associate and/or breeding partner are available in zoo-housed flocks.",0.006094622,0.003403683,0.03111935,0.010637119,0.003469556,0.006944627,0.002277625,0.003584587,0.010102225,0.020118846,0.006787035,0.004279298,0.004495223,0.009258522,0.003708236,0.005230444,0.002816933,0.004813242,0.008312904,0.008473048,0.001482349,0.03358747,0.004502142,0.021695223,0.00335224,0.020962361,0.002214317,0.006088134,0.005410658,"['fish', 'ray', 'rays', 'scomber japonicus']","[0.036363636363636, 0.09090909090909001, 0.09090909090909001, 0.0]","[0.399999999999999, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0]"

It is imperative that new anti-infective therapeutics be developed against problematic “superbugs.” The cyclic depsipeptide teixobactin holds much promise as a new class of antibiotics for highly resistant Gram-positive pathogens (e.g., methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA]). Understanding its molecular mechanism(s) of action could lead to the design of new compounds with a broader activity spectrum. Here, we describe the first metabolomics study to investigate the killing mechanism(s) of teixobactin against MRSA. Our findings revealed that teixobactin significantly disorganized the bacterial cell envelope, as reflected by a profound perturbation in the bacterial membrane lipids and cell wall biosynthesis (peptidoglycan and teichoic acid). Importantly, teixobactin significantly suppressed the main intermediate d-alanyl-d-lactate involved in the mechanism of vancomycin resistance in S. aureus. These novel results help explain the unique mechanism of action of teixobactin and its lack of cross-resistance with vancomycin. ABSTRACT Antibiotics have served humankind through their use in modern medicine as effective treatments for otherwise fatal bacterial infections. Teixobactin is a first member of newly discovered natural antibiotics that was recently identified from a hitherto-unculturable soil bacterium, Eleftheria terrae, and recognized as a potent antibacterial agent against various Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. The most distinctive characteristic of teixobactin as an effective antibiotic is that teixobactin resistance could not be evolved in a laboratory setting. It is purported that teixobactin’s “resistance-resistant” mechanism of action includes binding to the essential bacterial cell wall synthesis building blocks lipid II and lipid III. In the present study, metabolomics was used to investigate the potential metabolic pathways involved in the mechanisms of antibacterial activity of the synthetic teixobactin analogue Leu10-teixobactin against a MRSA strain, S. aureus ATCC 700699. The metabolomes of S. aureus ATCC 700699 cells 1, 3, and 6 h following treatment with Leu10-teixobactin (0.5 μg/ml, i.e., 0.5× MIC) were compared to those of the untreated controls. Leu10-teixobactin significantly perturbed bacterial membrane lipids (glycerophospholipids and fatty acids), peptidoglycan (lipid I and II) metabolism, and cell wall teichoic acid (lipid III) biosynthesis as early as after 1 h of treatment, reflecting an initial activity on the cell envelope. Concordant with its time-dependent antibacterial killing action, Leu10-teixobactin caused more perturbations in the levels of key intermediates in pathways of amino-sugar and nucleotide-sugar metabolism and their downstream peptidoglycan and teichoic acid biosynthesis at 3 and 6 h. Significant perturbations in arginine metabolism and the interrelated tricarboxylic acid cycle, histidine metabolism, pantothenate, and coenzyme A biosynthesis were also observed at 3 and 6 h. To conclude, this is the first study to provide novel metabolomics mechanistic information, which lends support to the development of teixobactin as an antibacterial drug for the treatment of multidrug-resistant Gram-positive infections.

Here, we show SR in a photodetector based on monolayer MoS2 for detecting ultra-low-intensity subthreshold optical signals from a distant light emitting diode (LED). We demonstrate that weak periodic LED signals, which are otherwise undetectable, can be detected by a MoS2 photodetector in the presence of a finite and optimum amount of white Gaussian noise at a frugal energy expenditure of few tens of nano-Joules.

Organ formation requires the integration of chemical and mechanical information, yet how this is achieved is poorly understood for most organs. Muscle compartments in zebrafish display a V shape, which is believed to be required for efficient swimming. We investigate how this structure emerges during zebrafish development, combining live imaging and quantitative analysis of cellular movements. We use theoretical modeling to understand how cell differentiation and mechanical interactions between tissues guide the emergence of a specific tissue morphology. Our work reveals how spatially modulating the mechanical environment around and within tissues can lead to complex organ shape formation. Organ formation is an inherently biophysical process, requiring large-scale tissue deformations. Yet, understanding how complex organ shape emerges during development remains a major challenge. During zebrafish embryogenesis, large muscle segments, called myotomes, acquire a characteristic chevron morphology, which is believed to aid swimming. Myotome shape can be altered by perturbing muscle cell differentiation or the interaction between myotomes and surrounding tissues during morphogenesis. To disentangle the mechanisms contributing to shape formation of the myotome, we combine single-cell resolution live imaging with quantitative image analysis and theoretical modeling. We find that, soon after segmentation from the presomitic mesoderm, the future myotome spreads across the underlying tissues. The mechanical coupling between the future myotome and the surrounding tissues appears to spatially vary, effectively resulting in spatially heterogeneous friction. Using a vertex model combined with experimental validation, we show that the interplay of tissue spreading and friction is sufficient to drive the initial phase of chevron shape formation. However, local anisotropic stresses, generated during muscle cell differentiation, are necessary to reach the acute angle of the chevron in wild-type embryos. Finally, tissue plasticity is required for formation and maintenance of the chevron shape, which is mediated by orientated cellular rearrangements. Our work sheds light on how a spatiotemporal sequence of local cellular events can have a nonlocal and irreversible mechanical impact at the tissue scale, leading to robust organ shaping.",0.0148027,0.007378786,0.2585123,0.006560236,0.013724346,0.09629504,0.009710572,0.004152772,0.33254975,0.01696191,0.005032147,0.00929974,0.0072647,0.004136908,0.00750805,0.005978661,0.024583148,0.002854687,0.003382844,0.013575559,0.00509259,0.010536108,0.013495318,0.09131742,0.003742936,0.006411584,0.004053609,0.011525417,0.022450669,['spiders'],[0.012345679012345002],[1.0]

We explore these ideas by studying how fission-fusion social structure arises in spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi) groups, exploring whether monkeys use social knowledge to collectively compute subgroup size distributions adaptive for foraging in variable environments. We assess whether individual decisions to stay in or leave subgroups are conditioned on strategies based on the presence or absence of others. We search for this evidence in a time series of subgroup membership. We find that individuals have multiple strategies, suggesting that the social knowledge of different individuals is important. These stay-leave strategies provide microscopic inputs to a stochastic model of collective computation encoded in a family of circuits. Each circuit represents an hypothesis for how collectives combine strategies to make decisions, and how these produce various subgroup size distributions. By running these circuits forward in simulation we generate new subgroup size distributions and measure how well they match food abundance in the environment using transfer entropies. We find that spider monkeys decide to stay or go using information from multiple individuals and that they can collectively compute a distribution of subgroup size that makes efficient use of ephemeral sources of nutrition. We are able to artificially tune circuits with subgroup size distributions that are a better fit to the environment than the observed. This suggests that a combination of measurement error, constraint, and adaptive lag are diminishing the power of collective computation in this system.

While community composition and diversity are the strongest predictors of CUE, abiotic factors modulated the relationship between diversity and CUE, with CUE being positively correlated with bacterial diversity only under high moisture.

The etiology is poorly understood, as the oral cavity harbors diverse communities of microorganisms. Using multiple imaging modalities on human teeth from patients with caries, we discovered a microbial community precisely arranged in a corona-like architecture. Moreover, this organization is mediated by the pathogen Streptococcus mutans through production of an extracellular scaffold that directs positioning of other oral microbes. We developed a methodology to quantify the spatial structure of microbial communities at the micron scale and found a precise spatial patterning of bacteria associated with localized caries onset. These findings are relevant as we approach the post-microbiome era, whereby quantifying the community structural organization may be essential for understanding microbiome function. Tooth decay (dental caries) is a widespread human disease caused by microbial biofilms. Streptococcus mutans, a biofilm-former, has been consistently associated with severe childhood caries; however, how this bacterium is spatially organized with other microorganisms in the oral cavity to promote disease remains unknown. Using intact biofilms formed on teeth of toddlers affected by caries, we discovered a unique 3D rotund-shaped architecture composed of multiple species precisely arranged in a corona-like structure with an inner core of S. mutans encompassed by outer layers of other bacteria. This architecture creates localized regions of acidic pH and acute enamel demineralization (caries) in a mixed-species biofilm model on human teeth, suggesting this highly ordered community as the causative agent. Notably, the construction of this architecture was found to be an active process initiated by production of an extracellular scaffold by S. mutans that assembles the corona cell arrangement, encapsulating the pathogen core. In addition, this spatial patterning creates a protective barrier against antimicrobials while increasing bacterial acid fitness associated with the disease-causing state.

It is thought to contribute to an organism’s ability to adapt to environmental change within a single generation, which may facilitate survival and increase fitness. Furthermore, plasticity has the potential to bias the direction and/or speed of evolution by changing patterns of phenotypic variation and exposing new genetic variation to selection (i.e., flexible stem evolution). Our understanding of this important phenomenon is incomplete owing to limited knowledge of the molecular underpinnings of reaction norm evolution. Using the teleost feeding apparatus as a model, we explore this open question and show that the Hh signaling pathway underlies the ability of this structure to respond plastically to alternate feeding regimes. Phenotypic plasticity, the ability of a single genotype to produce multiple phenotypes under different environmental conditions, is critical for the origins and maintenance of biodiversity; however, the genetic mechanisms underlying plasticity as well as how variation in those mechanisms can drive evolutionary change remain poorly understood. Here, we examine the cichlid feeding apparatus, an icon of both prodigious evolutionary divergence and adaptive phenotypic plasticity. We first provide a tissue-level mechanism for plasticity in craniofacial shape by measuring rates of bone deposition within functionally salient elements of the feeding apparatus in fishes forced to employ alternate foraging modes. We show that levels and patterns of phenotypic plasticity are distinct among closely related cichlid species, underscoring the evolutionary potential of this trait. Next, we demonstrate that hedgehog (Hh) signaling, which has been implicated in the evolutionary divergence of cichlid feeding architecture, is associated with environmentally induced rates of bone deposition. Finally, to demonstrate that Hh levels are the cause of the plastic response and not simply the consequence of producing more bone, we use transgenic zebrafish in which Hh levels could be experimentally manipulated under different foraging conditions.

Signals, however, can also expose signalers to nontarget receivers, including predators and parasites, and thus have also evolved to decrease enemy attraction. Here we show that male tree frogs (Smilisca sila) reduce their attractiveness to eavesdropping enemies (bats and midges) by overlapping their calls at near-perfect synchrony with the calls of neighboring conspecifics. By producing calls that closely follow those of other males, synchronizing S. sila take advantage of an auditory illusion where enemies are more attracted to the leading call. Female S. sila, however, are less susceptible to this illusion. Thus, synchronization among signaling males can result in acoustic crypsis from predators without affecting female attraction. Given the widespread use of conspicuous mating signals and eavesdropping enemies, perceptual exploitation of eavesdroppers is likely a common driver of signal evolution.",0.016236868,0.021434397,0.009815099,0.5552314,0.010819107,0.007766075,0.005941159,0.009569572,0.009257834,0.024768472,0.010188809,0.018214397,0.015174391,0.15091658,0.020799654,0.004611699,0.017960725,0.03436619,0.014294203,0.009391907,0.006722662,0.5128577,0.005778863,0.028859386,0.009792523,0.011364526,0.008898876,0.006810589,0.0070272,['chlamydomonas reinhardtii'],[0.022727272727272003],[1.0]

This radular harpoon serves both as projectile and conduit for venom delivery. In the fish-hunting cone snail Conus catus, the radular harpoon is also utilized to tether the snail to its prey, rapidly paralyzed by neuroexcitatory peptides [2,3]. Effective prey capture in C. catus requires both fast-acting neurotoxins and a delivery system quick enough to exceed the prey fish's rapid escape responses [4]. We report here that the cone snail's prey strike is one of the fastest in the animal kingdom. A unique cellular latch mechanism prevents harpoon release until sufficient pressure builds and overcomes the forces of the latch, resulting in rapid acceleration into prey [2]. The radular harpoon then rapidly decelerates as its bulbous base reaches the end of the proboscis, a distensible hydrostatic skeleton extended toward the prey [2], with little slowing during prey impalement. The velocities achieved are the fastest movements of any mollusk and exceed previous estimates by over an order of magnitude [1].",0.014553753,0.003232108,0.006761727,0.003230115,0.05855536,0.021745218,0.00448479,0.004034344,0.01784166,0.045277514,0.002061602,0.002307086,0.003237517,0.002742502,0.013518889,0.002829826,0.004593195,0.002371046,0.005552955,0.005622995,0.005134998,0.003423586,0.003026557,0.007293013,0.002981389,0.002843217,0.02326228,0.004510587,0.04037243,"['cyanobacteria', 'tortula inermis', 'syntrichia caninervis', 'mosses', 'bryum argenteum']","[0.008928571428571001, 0.008928571428571001, 0.0, 0.017857142857142003, 0.0]","[0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]"

Following the withdrawal of many broad‐spectrum pesticides, most importantly neonicotinoids, and with increased incidence of pyrethroid resistance, few chemical control options remain, resulting in the need for alternative pest management strategies. We identified the parasitoid wasp Microctonus brassicae (Haeselbarth) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) within CSFB collected from three independent sites in Norfolk, UK. Parasitism of adult CSFB was confirmed, and wasp oviposition behaviour was described. Moreover, we show that within captive colonies parasitism rates are sufficient to generate significant biological control of CSFB populations. A sequence of the M. brassicae mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 (MT‐CO1) gene was generated for rapid future identification. Moroccan specimens of Microctonus aethiopoides (Loan), possessing 90% sequence similarity, were the closest identified sequenced species.

To investigate this system, unique among vertebrates, we cyclically bent isolated segments of 10 vertebrae and nine joints. For the first time in the biomechanics of fish vertebral columns, we simultaneously characterized non-linear elasticity and viscosity throughout the bending oscillation, extending recently proposed techniques for large-amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) characterization to large-amplitude oscillatory bending (LAOB). The vertebral column segments behave as non-linear viscoelastic springs. Elastic properties dominate for all frequencies and curvatures tested, increasing as either variable increases. Non-linearities within a bending cycle are most in evidence at the highest frequency, 2.0 Hz, and curvature, 5 m−1. Viscous bending properties are greatest at low frequencies and high curvatures, with non-linear effects occurring at all frequencies and curvatures. The range of mechanical behaviors includes that of springs and brakes, with smooth transitions between them that allow for continuously variable power transmission by the vertebral column to assist in the mechanics of undulatory propulsion.

Whether RIP affects core genomic sequence in important ways is unknown. By parent-offspring whole genome sequencing, we estimate a mutation rate (3.38 ×  10−6 per bp per generation) that is two orders of magnitude higher than reported for any non-viral organism, with 93–98% of mutations being RIP-associated. RIP mutations are, however, relatively rare in coding sequence, in part because RIP preferentially attacks GC-poor long duplicates that interact in three dimensional space, while coding sequence duplicates are rare, GC-rich, short, and tend not to interact. Despite this, with over 5 coding sequence mutations per genome per generation, the mutational burden is an order of magnitude higher than the previously highest observed. Unexpectedly, the majority of these coding sequence mutations appear not to be the direct product of RIP being mostly in non-duplicate sequence and predominantly not C→T mutations. Nonetheless, RIP-deficient strains have over an order of magnitude fewer coding sequence mutations outside of duplicated domains than RIP-proficient strains. Neurospora crassa has the highest mutation rate and mutational burden of any non-viral life. While the high rate is largely due to the action of RIP, the mutational burden appears to be RIP-associated but not directly caused by RIP.",0.018601883,0.004374357,0.015725268,0.010242403,0.003589466,0.003114256,0.003387321,0.003438488,0.023950623,0.010012861,0.015866881,0.052863218,0.004924272,0.010210587,0.012634404,0.013266427,0.003158994,0.003591797,0.008138716,0.007176651,0.002376068,0.03260105,0.002084206,0.12962745,0.003217038,0.06770675,0.002467214,0.008489545,0.003968557,['ctenoides ales'],[0.022727272727272003],[1.0]

Light-scattering pigment granules within chromatocytes have been presumed to be the sole source of coloration in these complex organs. We report the discovery of structural coloration emanating in precise register with expanded pigmented chromatocytes. Concurrently, using an annotated squid chromatophore proteome together with microscopy, we identify a likely biochemical component of this reflective coloration as reflectin proteins distributed in sheath cells that envelop each chromatocyte. Additionally, within the chromatocytes, where the pigment resides in nanostructured granules, we find the lens protein Ω- crystallin interfacing tightly with pigment molecules. These findings offer fresh perspectives on the intricate biophotonic interplay between pigmentary and structural coloration elements tightly co-located within the same dynamic flexible organ - a feature that may help inspire the development of new classes of engineered materials that change color and pattern.Chromatophores in cephalopod skin are known for fast changes in coloration due to light-scattering pigment granules.

However, the relationship between the persistence of mutualisms and species richness has remained unclear. Vidal et al. used a synthetic mutualism in brewer's yeast to experimentally test whether species richness buffers mutualistic communities against exploitation by species that do not provide benefits in return. They showed that richer mutualist communities survive exploitation more often than pairwise mutualisms and that higher species richness and functional redundancy allow mutualist communities to persist in the presence of exploiters. These results provide experimental support for the hypothesis that species richness is necessary for the function and maintenance of mutualistic communities. Science, this issue p. 346 Experiments with yeast show that species richness buffers against loss of mutualistic interactions in ecological communities. Mutualisms, or reciprocally beneficial interspecific interactions, constitute the foundation of many ecological communities and agricultural systems. Mutualisms come in different forms, from pairwise interactions to extremely diverse communities, and they are continually challenged with exploitation by nonmutualistic community members (exploiters). Thus, understanding how mutualisms persist remains an essential question in ecology. Theory suggests that high species richness and functional redundancy could promote mutualism persistence in complex mutualistic communities. Using a yeast system (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), we experimentally show that communities with the greatest mutualist richness and functional redundancy are nearly two times more likely to survive exploitation than are simple communities. Persistence increased because diverse communities were better able to mitigate the negative effects of competition with exploiters. Thus, large mutualistic networks may be inherently buffered from exploitation.",0.029455163,0.008205595,0.012123019,0.3238308,0.008047838,0.006263649,0.006583004,0.007441615,0.002628067,0.024147267,0.011672006,0.009048934,0.014784011,0.16848524,0.00817271,0.00427971,0.009001429,0.008941335,0.013709032,0.008283082,0.003925707,0.2460888,0.00541197,0.021864658,0.010995966,0.016716808,0.00620537,0.006397959,0.005576495,[],[],[]

Population impacts of such harsh environmental events are theorized to vary with life history strategies among species. However, existing demographic models generally do not consider behavioural plasticity that may modify the impact of harsh events. Here we show that tropical songbirds in the New and Old Worlds reduced reproduction during drought, with greater reductions in species with higher average long-term survival. Large reductions in reproduction by longer-lived species were associated with higher survival during drought than predrought years in Malaysia, whereas shorter-lived species maintained reproduction and survival decreased. Behavioural strategies of longer-lived, but not shorter-lived, species mitigated the effect of increasing drought frequency on long-term population growth. Behavioural plasticity can buffer the impact of climate change on populations of some species and differences in plasticity among species related to their life histories are critical for predicting population trajectories.

However, their structure–activity relationships and mechanisms of action against fungal pathogens of plants are still largely unknown. A small highly cationic peptide NCR044 with potent antifungal activity has been identified. This peptide has a unique highly dynamic structure and exhibits multifaceted mechanisms of action against a fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. Exogenous application of this peptide confers resistance to a gray mold disease caused by B. cinerea in tobacco and tomato plants as well as postharvest products. Our work paves the way for future development of NCR peptides as spray-on antifungal agents. In the indeterminate nodules of a model legume Medicago truncatula, ∼700 nodule-specific cysteine-rich (NCR) peptides with conserved cysteine signature are expressed. NCR peptides are highly diverse in sequence, and some of these cationic peptides exhibit antimicrobial activity in vitro and in vivo. However, there is a lack of knowledge regarding their structural architecture, antifungal activity, and modes of action against plant fungal pathogens. Here, the three-dimensional NMR structure of the 36-amino acid NCR044 peptide was solved. This unique structure was largely disordered and highly dynamic with one four-residue α-helix and one three-residue antiparallel β-sheet stabilized by two disulfide bonds. NCR044 peptide also exhibited potent fungicidal activity against multiple plant fungal pathogens, including Botrytis cinerea and three Fusarium spp. It inhibited germination in quiescent spores of B. cinerea. In germlings, it breached the fungal plasma membrane and induced reactive oxygen species. It bound to multiple bioactive phosphoinositides in vitro. Time-lapse confocal and superresolution microscopy revealed strong fungal cell wall binding, penetration of the cell membrane at discrete foci, followed by gradual loss of turgor, subsequent accumulation in the cytoplasm, and elevated levels in nucleoli of germlings. Spray-applied NCR044 significantly reduced gray mold disease symptoms caused by the fungal pathogen B. cinerea in tomato and tobacco plants, and postharvest products.

This is regulated by a brainstem reflex pathway. Here, we investigate whether this pathway is under the control of internal models about the environment. This would allow adjusting pupil dynamics to environmental statistics to augment information transmission. We present image sequences containing internal temporal structure to humans of either sex and male macaque monkeys. We then measure whether the pupil tracks this temporal structure not only at the rate of luminance variations, but also at the rate of statistics not available from luminance information alone. We find entrainment to environmental statistics in both species. This entrainment directly affects visual processing by increasing sensitivity at the environmentally relevant temporal frequency. Thus, pupil dynamics are matched to the temporal structure of the environment to optimize perception, in line with an active sensing account. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT When light hits the retina, the pupil reflexively constricts. This determines how much light and thus how much information is available for visual processing. We show that the rate at which the pupil constricts and dilates is matched to the temporal structure of our visual environment, although this information is not directly contained in the light variations that usually trigger reflexive pupil constrictions. Adjusting pupil diameter in accordance with environmental regularities optimizes information transmission at ecologically relevant temporal frequencies. We show that this is the case in humans and macaque monkeys, suggesting that the reflex pathways that regulate pupil diameter are under some degree of cognitive control across primate species.",0.0155414,0.83014685,0.018667348,0.013001299,0.010816724,0.009530692,0.009803534,0.013594812,0.014620046,0.006321097,0.005488439,0.010667608,0.009411247,0.007799204,0.006896509,0.005224939,0.00988056,0.016063493,0.008374967,0.010404155,0.008632173,0.030511592,0.015100927,0.00897955,0.008597622,0.012866836,0.009308429,0.008220486,0.011811012,"['canis lupus', 'bird', 'canis lupus familiaris', 'chelonia mydas', 'eretmochelys', 'caretta', 'rupornis magnirostris', 'mydas', 'humans', 'chelonia', 'lepidochelys', 'tyto furcata', 'caiman latirostris', 'eretmochelys imbricata', 'mammals', 'canis', 'birds', 'tyto', 'caretta caretta', 'lepidochelys olivacea', 'ara ararauna', 'equus caballus']","[0.0, 0.038961038961038, 0.0, 0.012987012987012, 0.012987012987012, 0.025974025974025, 0.012987012987012, 0.012987012987012, 0.012987012987012, 0.012987012987012, 0.012987012987012, 0.012987012987012, 0.0, 0.012987012987012, 0.025974025974025, 0.012987012987012, 0.025974025974025, 0.012987012987012, 0.012987012987012, 0.012987012987012, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304, 0.6666666666666661, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304, 0.0, 0.33333333333333304, 0.6666666666666661, 0.33333333333333304, 0.6666666666666661, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304, 0.0, 0.0]"

Proteolysis is an overlooked post-translational modification (PTM) that increases venom complexity. The tripeptide KPP (Lys-Pro-Pro) is a peptide encrypted in the C-terminus of Ts14 - a 25-mer peptide from the venom of Tityus serrulatus scorpion that has a positive impact on the cardiovascular system, inducing vasodilation and reducing arterial blood pressure of hypertensive rats, among other beneficial effects. A previous study reported that KPP and its native peptide Ts14 act via activation of the bradykinin receptor B2 (B2R). However, the cellular events underlying the activation of B2R by KPP are unknown. To study the cell signaling triggered by the Ts14 cryptide KPP, we incubated cardiac myocytes isolated from C57BL/6 mice with KPP (10-7 mol.L-1) for 0 min, 5 min or 30 min and explored the proteome and phosphoproteome. Our results showed that KPP regulated cardiomyocyte proteins associated with, but not limited to, apoptosis, muscle contraction, protein turnover, and the respiratory chain. We also reported that KPP led to AKT phosphorylation, activating AKT and its downstream target eNOS. We also observed that KPP led to dephosphorylation of phospholamban (PLN) at its activation sites (S16 and T17) leading to reduced contractility of treated cardiomyocytes. Some cellular targets reported here for KPP (e.g., AKT, PLN and ERK) have already been reported to protect cardiac tissue of hypoxia-induced injury. Hence, this study suggests potential beneficial effects of this scorpion cryptide that needs to be further investigated, for example as a drug lead for cardiac infarction.",0.006518256,0.001777646,0.007335139,0.002554068,0.03025162,0.003071828,0.004280041,0.004462638,0.02410046,0.00395336,0.003977367,0.007254061,0.003977529,0.003346451,0.003321092,0.007882052,0.007375639,0.003456837,0.00415178,0.003562751,0.001758661,0.010085801,0.004537389,0.004882729,0.00274536,0.03661175,0.003150924,0.003758585,0.0052431,[],[],[]

Orb-Weaver Spiders Inhabiting Ant–Acacias Capture Both Herbivorous Insects and Acacia Ant Alates,"Abstract The orb-weaver spiders Eustala oblonga (Chickering) and Eustala illicita (O. Picard-Cambridge) (Araneae: Araneidae) inhabit the ant-defended acacias Vachellia melanocerus (Beurling) and Vachellia collinsii (Safford) (Fabales: Fabaceae), respectively, in Panama. These spiders do not capture patrolling Pseudomyrmex ants but exploit their plant-protection services to escape predation. What effect the spiders have on the ant-acacia mutualisms is unknown. They may provide an additional layer of plant defense by capturing flying herbivorous insects in their webs. Alternatively, the spiders may disrupt the ant–acacia mutualisms by capturing alate acacia ants during nuptial flights. We evaluated these two hypotheses by sampling insects flying through acacia foliage and by identifying prey remains in webs. The proportions of insects captured on sticky card traps and in webs varied with taxonomic order and ecological role. Herbivorous insects greatly outnumbered other groups captured on sticky cards and were captured in spiders’ webs in both acacia species but made up a minority of prey remains in webs. Instead, insect predators and parasitoids made up the majority of prey remains and were comprised primarily by alate ant mutualists of the host acacias. These results provide indirect support for both hypotheses and suggest that the spiders potentially both benefit and harm their host ant-acacia mutualisms. The net effect of spider exploitation, however, is unclear and is likely based on both the effectiveness of plant protection from herbivory provided by the spiders relative to that provided by acacia ants, as well as the overall proportion of the ant reproductive caste the spiders actually capture.",0.009391082,0.00773121,0.005355805,0.0297753,0.006808328,0.003117306,0.002966458,0.005373761,0.002145639,0.007360459,0.00480358,0.004524343,0.01120039,0.18503399,0.007377252,0.003963682,0.004492791,0.005329452,0.006221755,0.002507262,0.002516246,0.005118487,0.004031149,0.011248861,0.011497473,0.01456435,0.006844669,0.009207382,0.007813726,"['cryptosporidium parvum', 'bacteria', 'apicomplexans', 'teredinibacter turnerae', 'toxoplasma gondii', 'mouse', 'humans', 'mice']","[0.011904761904761, 0.011904761904761, 0.011904761904761, 0.011904761904761, 0.011904761904761, 0.011904761904761, 0.011904761904761, 0.011904761904761]","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]"

In this context, intrinsic properties emerging from microbial interactions, such as efficient organization optimizing growth and activities in multispecies biofilms, may become the object of fitness selection. However, little is known on the nature of underlying interspecies interactions during establishment of a predictable spatial organization within multispecies biofilms. We present a comparative metatranscriptomic analysis of bacterial strains residing in triple-species and four-species biofilms, aiming at deciphering molecular mechanisms underpinning bacterial interactions responsible of the remarkably enhanced biomass production and associated typical spatial organization they display. Metatranscriptomic profiles concurred with changes in micro-site occupation in response to the addition/removal of a single species, being driven by both cooperation, competition, and facilitation processes. We conclude that the enhanced biomass production of the four-species biofilm is an intrinsic community property emerging from finely tuned space optimization achieved through concerted antagonistic and mutualistic interactions, where each species occupies a defined micro-site favoring its own growth. Our results further illustrate how molecular mechanisms can be better interpreted when supported by visual imaging of actual microscopic spatial organization, and we propose phenotypic adaptation selected by social interactions as molecular mechanisms stabilizing microbial communities.",0.02197484,0.005641376,0.25525475,0.013250108,0.0152695,0.008413192,0.007487367,0.06889046,0.031370662,0.012489847,0.124927804,0.029400725,0.015829323,0.008829564,0.029515043,0.01674778,0.009170177,0.007615118,0.01612765,0.01988305,0.010006662,0.013846982,0.007081403,0.8810368,0.01834356,0.023906114,0.005071541,0.010612237,0.010508499,"['vertebrates', 'fish', 'fishes']","[0.013333333333333001, 0.026666666666666002, 0.013333333333333001]","[0.5, 1.0, 0.5]"

This study compared the structure and morphology of 16 hearts from chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) which were either healthy or affected by myocardial fibrosis using X-ray microtomography. In four hearts, a single, hyperdense structure was detected within the right fibrous trigone of the cardiac skeleton. High resolution scans and histopathology revealed trabecular bones in two cases, hyaline cartilage in another case and a focus of mineralised fibro-cartilaginous metaplasia with endochondral ossification in the last case. Four other animals presented with multiple foci of ectopic calcification within the walls of the great vessels. All hearts affected by marked myocardial fibrosis presented with bone or cartilage formation, and increased collagen levels in tissues adjacent to the bone/cartilage, while unaffected hearts did not present with os cordis or cartilago cordis. The presence of an os cordis has been described in some ruminants, camelids, and otters, but never in great apes.

Moths lacking such ears could still gain protection from bat biosonar by using stealth acoustic camouflage, absorbing sound waves rather than reflecting them back as echoes. The thorax of a moth is bulky and hence acoustically highly reflective. This renders it an obvious target for any bat. Much of the thorax of moths is covered in hair-like scales, the layout of which is remarkably similar in structure and arrangement to natural fibrous materials commonly used in sound insulation. Despite this structural similarity, the effect of thorax scales on moth echoes has never been characterized. Here, we test whether and how moth thorax scales function as an acoustic absorber. From tomographic echo images, we find that the thin layer of thoracic scales of diurnal butterflies affects the strength of ultrasound echoes from the thorax very little, while the thorax scales of earless moths absorbs an average of 67 ± 9% of impinging ultrasonic sound energy. We show that the thorax scales of moths provide acoustic camouflage by acting as broadband (20–160 kHz) stealth coating. Modelling results suggest the scales are acting as a porous sound absorber; however, the thorax scales of moths achieve a considerably higher absorption than technical fibrous porous absorbers with the same structural parameters. Such scales, despite being thin and lightweight, constitute a broadband, multidirectional and efficient ultrasound absorber that reduces the moths' detectability to hunting bats and gives them a survival advantage.",0.021112254,0.007764132,0.00251065,0.012869096,0.005383998,0.009674167,0.003334564,0.00203798,0.003891306,0.02987344,0.003208422,0.002334124,0.005700224,0.016368572,0.003710276,0.002350052,0.014509196,0.08947571,0.011056127,0.012250158,0.005675669,0.048577514,0.003789745,0.007289126,0.004966662,0.008655824,0.006399821,0.00580193,0.006480178,[],[],[]

However, not all sex-specific features are static: for example, C. elegans males (XO) can sometimes exhibit hermaphrodite (XX)-like feeding behavior [1, 2]. (C. elegans hermaphrodites are somatic females that transiently produce self-sperm.) Essentially all somatic sex differences in C. elegans are governed by the master regulator tra-1, whose activity is controlled by chromosomal sex and is necessary and sufficient to specify the hermaphrodite state [3]. One aspect of this state is high expression of the chemoreceptor odr-10. In hermaphrodites, high odr-10 expression promotes feeding, but in males, low odr-10 expression facilitates exploration [4]. However, males suppress this sex difference in two contexts: juvenile males exhibit high odr-10 expression and food deprivation activates odr-10 in adult males [4-6]. Remarkably, we find that both of these phenomena require tra-1. In juvenile (L3) males, tra-1 is expressed in numerous neurons; this expression diminishes as individuals mature into adulthood, a process that requires conserved regulators of sexual maturation. tra-1 remains expressed in a small number of neurons in adult males, where it likely has a permissive role in odr-10 activation. Thus, the neuronal functions of tra-1 are not limited to hermaphrodites; rather, tra-1 also acts in the male nervous system to transiently suppress a sexual dimorphism, developmentally and in response to nutritional stress. Our results show that the molecular and functional representation of sexual state in C. elegans is neither static nor homogeneous, challenging traditional notions about the nature of biological sex.",0.013246329,0.006022098,0.012187484,0.06397159,0.002807754,0.003820028,0.001935788,0.004521692,0.04160217,0.052086405,0.006118225,0.041867096,0.005050774,0.012994668,0.002483524,0.002956289,0.003632432,0.010851518,0.008991499,0.005963994,0.003128815,0.086820565,0.00372306,0.00885004,0.002974795,0.007936548,0.002394337,0.011965038,0.005453893,"['honeycomb', 'jumping spiders', 'birds', 'butterflies', 'spiders']","[0.017543859649122, 0.017543859649122, 0.017543859649122, 0.157894736842105, 0.017543859649122]","[0.11111111111111101, 0.11111111111111101, 0.11111111111111101, 1.0, 0.11111111111111101]"

We have developed a fluorescence-imaging platform to simultaneously measure carboxysome number, position, and activity over time in a growing cyanobacterial population, allowing individual carboxysomes to be clustered on the basis of activity and spatial dynamics.

Previously, it has been speculated that the biosynthesis of all benzoquinones originates from one core precursor, 1,4-hydroquinone. Careful ligation of the base of the reservoir chamber enabled us to prevent the explosive reaction and sample untransformed reservoir fluid, which showed that it accumulates significant quantities of 1,4-hydroquinone and 2-methyl-1,4-hydroquinone. We investigated the biosynthetic mechanisms leading to quinone formation by injecting or feeding Brachinus elongatulus beetles with stable-isotope-labeled precursors. Chemical analysis of defensive secretion samples obtained from 1,4-hydroquinone-d6-administered beetles demonstrated that it underwent conversion specifically to 1,4-benzoquinone. Analogously, results from m-cresol-d8 injected or fed beetles confirmed that m-cresol is metabolized to 2-methyl-1,4-hydroquinone, which is then oxidized to 2-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone in the hot spray. Our results refute the previous claim that 1,4-hydroquinone is the precursor of all substituted benzoquinones in bombardier beetles and reveal that they are biosynthetic products of two independent pathways. Most likely, the aforementioned biosynthetic channel of hydroxylation of appropriate phenolic precursors and subsequent oxidation is not restricted to bombardier beetles; it could well be a general pathway that leads to the formation of all congeners of benzoquinones, one of the most widely distributed groups of defensive compounds in arthropods.

In theory, this enables birds to discriminate a broad range of colors, including many nonspectral colors. Nonspectral colors are perceived when nonadjacent cone types (sensitive to widely separated parts of the light spectrum) are predominantly stimulated. For humans, purple (stimulation of blue- and red-sensitive cones) is a nonspectral color; birds’ fourth color cone type creates many more possibilities. We trained wild hummingbirds to participate in color vision tests, which revealed that they can discriminate a variety of nonspectral colors, including UV+red, UV+green, purple, and UV+yellow. Additionally, based on an analysis of ∼3,300 plumage and plant colors, we estimate that birds perceive many natural colors as nonspectral. Many animals have the potential to discriminate nonspectral colors. For humans, purple is the clearest example of a nonspectral color. It is perceived when two color cone types in the retina (blue and red) with nonadjacent spectral sensitivity curves are predominantly stimulated. Purple is considered nonspectral because no monochromatic light (such as from a rainbow) can evoke this simultaneous stimulation. Except in primates and bees, few behavioral experiments have directly examined nonspectral color discrimination, and little is known about nonspectral color perception in animals with more than three types of color photoreceptors. Birds have four color cone types (compared to three in humans) and might perceive additional nonspectral colors such as UV+red and UV+green. Can birds discriminate nonspectral colors, and are these colors behaviorally and ecologically relevant? Here, using comprehensive behavioral experiments, we show that wild hummingbirds can discriminate a variety of nonspectral colors. We also show that hummingbirds, relative to humans, likely perceive a greater proportion of natural colors as nonspectral. Our analysis of plumage and plant spectra reveals many colors that would be perceived as nonspectral by birds but not by humans: Birds’ extra cone type allows them not just to see UV light but also to discriminate additional nonspectral colors. Our results support the idea that birds can distinguish colors throughout tetrachromatic color space and indicate that nonspectral color perception is vital for signaling and foraging. Since tetrachromacy appears to have evolved early in vertebrates, this capacity for rich nonspectral color perception is likely widespread.",0.011268474,0.086413614,0.004511958,0.013203505,0.009235438,0.006158351,0.003991645,0.01640465,0.00958792,0.007592794,0.007201587,0.00868567,0.015563186,0.007648302,0.00502105,0.003045018,0.005386596,0.42974216,0.007127004,0.007062207,0.006475434,0.029670056,0.010464661,0.007328053,0.008154108,0.008828129,0.008776545,0.005782796,0.006813469,[],[],[]

However, it is unknown to what extent morpho-kinematic features of cetaceans are intertwined to maximize their efficiency. By interchanging the shape and kinematic variables of five cetacean species, the interplay of their flukes morpho-kinematic features is examined by characterizing their thrust, power and propulsive efficiency. It is determined that the shape and kinematics of the flukes have considerable influence on force production and power consumption. Three-dimensional heaving and pitching scaling laws are developed by considering both added mass and circulatory-based forces, which are shown to closely model the numerical data. Using the scaling relations as a guide, it is determined that the added mass forces are important in predicting the trend between the efficiency and aspect ratio, however, the thrust and power are driven predominately by the circulatory forces. The scaling laws also reveal that there is an optimal dimensionless heave-to-pitch ratio h* that maximizes the efficiency. Moreover, the optimal h* varies with the aspect ratio, the amplitude-to-chord ratio and the Lighthill number. This indicates that the shape and kinematics of propulsors are intertwined, that is, there are specific kinematics that are tailored to the shape of a propulsor in order to maximize its propulsive efficiency.",0.029751157,0.005907397,0.009996398,0.003351129,0.007979343,0.23709953,0.004042349,0.004646781,0.013763063,0.013468047,0.004630112,0.006812798,0.005608465,0.005553571,0.003087531,0.003827688,0.058940902,0.005805713,0.008325316,0.23843086,0.007358636,0.008398253,0.007604765,0.01046833,0.003443293,0.007584588,0.003918047,0.004682252,0.028090939,"['buckeye', 'blues', 'insects', 'butterflies']","[0.010869565217391, 0.010869565217391, 0.032608695652173, 0.065217391304347]","[0.16666666666666602, 0.16666666666666602, 0.5, 1.0]"

This has been attributed to changes in instantaneous neuronal states determining the system's excitability. Yet the spatiotemporal organization of these dynamics remains poorly understood. Here we test whether variability in stimulus-evoked activity can be interpreted within the framework of criticality, which postulates dynamics of neural systems to be tuned toward the phase transition between stability and instability as is reflected in scale-free fluctuations in spontaneous neural activity. Using a novel noninvasive approach in 33 male human participants, we tracked instantaneous cortical excitability by inferring the magnitude of excitatory postsynaptic currents from the N20 component of the somatosensory evoked potential. Fluctuations of cortical excitability demonstrated long-range temporal dependencies decaying according to a power law across trials, a hallmark of systems at critical states. As these dynamics covaried with changes in prestimulus oscillatory activity in the alpha band (8-13 Hz), we establish a mechanistic link between ongoing and evoked activity through cortical excitability and argue that the co-emergence of common temporal power laws may indeed originate from neural networks poised close to a critical state. In contrast, no signatures of criticality were found in subcortical or peripheral nerve activity. Thus, criticality may represent a parsimonious organizing principle of variability in stimulus-related brain processes on a cortical level, possibly reflecting a delicate equilibrium between robustness and flexibility of neural responses to external stimuli. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Variability of neural responses in primary sensory areas is puzzling, as it is detrimental to the exact mapping between stimulus features and neural activity. However, such variability can be beneficial for information processing in neural networks if it is of a specific nature, namely, if dynamics are poised at a so-called critical state characterized by a scale-free spatiotemporal structure. Here, we demonstrate the existence of a link between signatures of criticality in ongoing and evoked activity through cortical excitability, which fills the long-standing gap between two major directions of research on neural variability: the impact of instantaneous brain states on stimulus processing on the one hand and the scale-free organization of spatiotemporal network dynamics of spontaneous activity on the other.",0.008422231,0.013799095,0.03347958,0.013454819,0.008357142,0.003262533,0.006539532,0.009436,0.032430325,0.004383233,0.00986582,0.025749603,0.007607594,0.005402233,0.005255159,0.007566041,0.020203585,0.011136466,0.010993302,0.006750749,0.007391754,0.57803583,0.012288059,0.011605766,0.005277092,0.011041898,0.004358273,0.003428647,0.008942514,[],[],[]

The trap actuation principles required to overcome the involved energy barrier, as determined by the double-lobe curvature, have remained speculative until now. Here we used 3D digital image correlation for the analysis of trap deformation during closure for both the outer and the inner trap surfaces. Accompanying biomechanical and physiological experiments revealed that successful snapping relies on full trap hydration. In combination with FEM simulations elucidating the mechanical contribution of the various trap tissues to the motion, we show that the trapping mechanics incorporate an elaborate interplay between swelling/shrinking processes of the various tissue layers and the release of trap-internal prestress. The mechanical principles for fast snapping in the iconic Venus flytrap are not yet fully understood. In this study, we obtained time-resolved strain distributions via three-dimensional digital image correlation (DIC) for the outer and inner trap-lobe surfaces throughout the closing motion. In combination with finite element models, the various possible contributions of the trap tissue layers were investigated with respect to the trap’s movement behavior and the amount of strain required for snapping. Supported by in vivo experiments, we show that full trap turgescence is a mechanical–physiological prerequisite for successful (fast and geometrically correct) snapping, driven by differential tissue changes (swelling, shrinking, or no contribution). These are probably the result of the previous accumulation of internal hydrostatic pressure (prestress), which is released after trap triggering. Our research leads to an in-depth mechanical understanding of a complex plant movement incorporating various actuation principles.",0.004143156,0.005679546,0.02134002,0.003938751,0.06510807,0.04801472,0.016442252,0.003716037,0.066407934,0.004719778,0.004279108,0.002974273,0.008347323,0.00507454,0.026547413,0.002449537,0.08647572,0.003350874,0.004248293,0.008865433,0.049240414,0.007892141,0.005916735,0.021353632,0.00631438,0.005363825,0.036639504,0.003032954,0.026689606,"['whales', 'insects']","[0.016949152542372, 0.016949152542372]","[1.0, 1.0]"

One explanation for this variation is that individuals face differential benefits or costs depending on the group’s order, but empirical evidence for this is lacking. Here we show that in three-spined sticklebacks ( Gasterosteus aculeatus ), fish that are first to respond to an ephemeral food source do so faster when shoals are in a disordered, swarm-like state. This is because individuals’ visual fields collectively cover more of their environment, meaning private information is more readily available in disordered groups. Once social information becomes available, however, the arrival times of subsequent group members to the food are faster in more ordered, polarized groups. Our data further suggest that first responding individuals (those that benefit from group disorder) maintain larger differences in heading angle to their nearest neighbours when shoaling, thereby explaining how conflict over whether private or social information is favoured can drive dynamic changes in collective behaviour. In animal groups, the degree of alignment of individuals could have different benefits and costs for individuals depending on their reliance on private or social information. Here the authors show that in shoals of three-spined sticklebacks, some individuals reach resources faster when groups are disordered, a state which favours reliance on privately acquired information, while other individuals reach resources faster when groups are ordered, allowing them to exploit social information more effectively.",0.019773727,0.031244436,0.018733036,0.010205359,0.002350031,0.014075116,0.002825022,0.002886766,0.017188514,0.006899001,0.003284978,0.005733119,0.004822549,0.005128345,0.001866014,0.004080602,0.00746314,0.010024879,0.003670348,0.015115855,0.003981546,0.13063335,0.010774353,0.006761462,0.002610998,0.005450629,0.002389281,0.003807582,0.013469322,"['vertebrates', 'cucumber', 'apostichopus japonicus']","[0.017857142857142003, 0.017857142857142003, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0]"

We show that changing the fin's curvature modulates its stiffness. Modelling the fin as bendable bony rays held together by a membrane, we deduce that fin curvature is manifested as a misalignment of the principal bending axes between neighbouring rays. An external force causes neighbouring rays to bend and splay apart, and thus stretches the membrane. This coupling between bending the rays and stretching the membrane underlies the increase in stiffness. Using three-dimensional reconstruction of a mackerel (Scomber japonicus) pectoral fin for illustration, we calculate the range of stiffnesses this fin is expected to span by changing curvature. The three-dimensional reconstruction shows that, even in its geometrically flat state, a functional curvature is embedded within the fin microstructure owing to the morphology of individual rays. As the ability of a propulsive surface to transmit force to the surrounding fluid is limited by its stiffness, the fin curvature controls the coupling between the fish and its surrounding fluid. Thereby, our results provide mechanical underpinnings and morphological predictions for the hypothesis that the spanned range of fin stiffnesses correlates with the behaviour and the ecological niche of the fish.",0.021201579,0.007085266,0.019003825,0.00439595,0.026229985,0.7185363,0.009013747,0.005109071,0.2111481,0.016525317,0.007889338,0.005535908,0.010319408,0.005636283,0.006477613,0.004074675,0.03975341,0.005878733,0.004607488,0.09957275,0.012345941,0.006219188,0.016642855,0.013477852,0.005098372,0.008403301,0.007512959,0.006578459,0.029118521,['synoicum adareanum'],[0.012195121951219001],[1.0]

Plants must manage cell swelling during flooding, rehydration, and pathogenesis–but little is known about the mechanisms by which this occurs. It has been proposed that plant cells could sense and respond to cell swelling through the action of mechanosensitive ion channels. Here we develop and characterize a new assay to study the effects of cell swelling on Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings and to test the contributions of the mechanosensitive ion channel MscS-Like10 (MSL10). The assay incorporates both cell wall softening and hypo-osmotic treatment to induce cell swelling. We show that MSL10 is required for previously demonstrated responses to hypo-osmotic shock, including a cytoplasmic calcium transient within the first few seconds, accumulation of ROS within the first 30 minutes, and increased transcript levels of mechano-inducible genes within 60 minutes. We also show that cell swelling induces programmed cell death within 3 hours, also in a MSL10-dependent manner. Finally, we show that MSL10 is unable to potentiate cell swelling-induced death when phosphomimetic residues are introduced into its soluble N-terminus. Thus, MSL10 functions as a phospho-regulated membrane-based sensor that connects the perception of cell swelling to a downstream signaling cascade and programmed cell death.",0.040662445,0.006023114,0.017366849,0.008151948,0.0175927,0.006502969,0.011297199,0.009592014,0.3778075,0.006874942,0.016066689,0.21171083,0.003568294,0.007759784,0.004377585,0.1849448,0.004437438,0.008533815,0.039106905,0.015735367,0.002946135,0.0381797,0.015011793,0.02775564,0.005132867,0.029089544,0.00487055,0.013878643,0.005295896,"['nanos', 'weevils']","[0.14285714285714202, 0.14285714285714202]","[1.0, 1.0]"

The latter pathway features an isothiocyanate hydrolase that is homologous to a previously characterized bacterial enzyme, and converts isothiocyanate into products that are not toxic to the fungus. The isothiocyanate hydrolase promotes fungal growth in the presence of the toxins, and contributes to the virulence of S. sclerotiorum on glucosinolate-producing plants. Some plants produce toxic isothiocyanates that protect them against pathogens.

As some gating modifier toxins have affinity for model lipid bilayers, a tripartite relationship among gating modifier toxins, voltage-gated ion channels, and the lipid membrane surrounding the channels has been proposed. We previously designed an HwTx-IV analogue (gHwTx-IV) with reduced negative charge and increased hydrophobic surface profile, which displays increased lipid bilayer affinity and in vitro activity at the voltage-gated sodium channel subtype 1.7 (NaV1.7), a channel targeted in pain management. Here, we show that replacements of the positively-charged residues that contribute to the activity of the peptide can improve gHwTx-IV's potency and selectivity for NaV1.7. Using HwTx-IV, gHwTx-IV, [R26A]gHwTx-IV, [K27A]gHwTx-IV, and [R29A]gHwTx-IV variants, we examined their potency and selectivity at human NaV1.7 and their affinity for the lipid bilayer. [R26A]gHwTx-IV consistently displayed the most improved potency and selectivity for NaV1.7, examined alongside off-target NaVs, compared with HwTx-IV and gHwTx-IV. The lipid affinity of each of the three novel analogues was weaker than that of gHwTx-IV, but stronger than that of HwTx-IV, suggesting a possible relationship between in vitro potency at NaV1.7 and affinity for lipid bilayers. In a murine NaV1.7 engagement model, [R26A]gHwTx-IV exhibited an efficacy comparable with that of native HwTx-IV.

However, it is not clear which guidance mechanisms operate to promote axon path finding in the adult. Scimone et al. addressed this question by investigating regeneration of the planarian visual system (see the Perspective by Roberts-Galbraith). Distinct muscle cell populations were found in close association with photoreceptor axons that, together with a neuron class, facilitated visual system assembly after diverse injuries or eye transplantations. These cells exhibited features similar to embryonic guidepost cells and were specified independently of eyes in precise locations by the action of adult positional information cues. Absence of these guidepost-like cells was associated with defective neuronal wiring in regeneration. Science, this issue p. eaba3203; see also p. 1428 Adult regeneration requires guidepost-like cells for precise rewiring of the eyes in the flatworm Schmidtea mediterranea. INTRODUCTION Multiple strategies exist to promote precise wiring of developing neuronal circuits. One strategy involves guidepost cells, which exist transiently in embryos. Guidepost cells can act as intermediate guidance targets for axons or by providing a scaffold that facilitates axonal targeting. Most guidance mechanisms become dispensable once the circuit is assembled. Loss of guidance mechanisms creates a potential limitation on regeneration of neuronal patterns—yet some animals are capable of functional regeneration of their nervous system. RATIONALE Assuming some adult animals have the ability to regenerate functional neuronal circuits, they must possess mechanism(s) for de novo repair of neuronal patterns. In this study, we aimed to characterize such mechanisms by studying regeneration of the planarian visual system after diverse injuries. RESULTS We identified a rare subset of muscle cells (notum+; frizzled 5/8-4+) concentrated at two precise anatomical locations and in tight association with photoreceptor axons. The first group of these cells was found near the eye, where visual axons project and fasciculate to form a bundle. The second group of these cells was found near choice points, where sorting of contralateral and ipsilateral axons occurs. Both groups of muscle cells were formed during regeneration of the visual system and were always tightly associated with axonal projections, consistent with a possible role in attraction to facilitate visual system assembly. In addition, we found that a notum+ set of neurons, located at the adult anterior brain commissure, regenerated before axonal midline crossing and was associated with optic chiasm regeneration. We reasoned that if the photoreceptor axon–associated notum+; frizzled 5/8-4+ muscle cells have a guidepost-like function, their formation should be independent of eye cells. Eyes transplanted to ectopic anatomical locations did not result in the formation of notum+; frizzled 5/8-4+ muscle cells. Furthermore, animals that were unable to generate eyes [ovo RNA interference (ovo RNAi) animals] were still capable of specifying these muscle cells at the right locations. In addition, we predicted that if these muscle cells were indeed guidepost-like cells, visual axon trajectories should be associated with them after eye transplantation into eyeless heads. In all instances, axons from transplanted eyes projected toward notum+; frizzled 5/8- 4+ muscle cells and often adjusted their trajectories after encountering them. We found that an array of signaling cues, which provide positional information essential for planarian patterning, was required for dictating the precise location of these guidepost-like cells. This provides a visual system–extrinsic mechanism for placing guidepost-like cells in the adult. Finally, with single-cell RNA sequencing and fluorescent in situ hybridization screening, we identified molecules and transcription factors expressed in these cells. RNAi studies reduced or eliminated muscle or neuronal guidepost-like cell subsets and resulted in aberrant patterns of visual axonal trajectories. CONCLUSION Adult molecular and cellular strategies for regenerating neuronal pattern in the absence of embryo-specific contexts must exist to overcome damage or loss after injury. Understanding these mechanisms might provide important insights for regenerative medicine. Here, we found adult guidepost-like cell populations, extrinsic to the visual system and placed by adult positional information, that promote normal visual system regeneration in planarians. Adult guidepost-like cells facilitate visual system regeneration in planarians. Muscle and neuron guidepost-like cells are present at key locations near the planarian visual system and are formed independently of photoreceptor axons. Regenerating and transplanted eyes target projections to guidepost-like cells. Positional information cues provide an eye-extrinsic mechanism to place guidepost-like cells in the adult. Loss of guidepost-like cells is associated with visual system disruption. wnt-5, slit, and ndk are involved in positional control of guidepost-like cell placement. fz5/8-4, frizzled 5/8-4. Neuronal circuits damaged or lost after injury can be regenerated in some adult organisms, but the mechanisms enabling this process are largely unknown. We used the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea to study visual system regeneration after injury. We identify a rare population of muscle cells tightly associated with photoreceptor axons at stereotyped positions in both uninjured and regenerating animals. Together with a neuronal population, these cells promote de novo assembly of the visual system in diverse injury and eye transplantation contexts. These muscle guidepost-like cells are specified independently of eyes, and their position is defined by an extrinsic array of positional information cues. These findings provide a mechanism, involving adult formation of guidepost-like cells typically observed in embryos, for axon pattern restoration in regeneration.",0.027232248,0.46361196,0.06790982,0.03513264,0.005761989,0.015381091,0.00693251,0.013477256,0.014506851,0.006936447,0.004659071,0.013877274,0.009463714,0.010927531,0.009854829,0.003347867,0.026984658,0.009853164,0.006869784,0.00610143,0.005632797,0.1304272,0.010490695,0.028717875,0.006229889,0.006684139,0.007178635,0.00704466,0.01069626,['saccharomyces cerevisiae'],[0.0],[0]

It is believed that cells have narrow distributions of sizes as a consequence of a homeostasis that allows bacteria to function at the optimal conditions. Several phenomenological approaches to explain these observations have been presented, but the microscopic origins of the cell-size regulation are still not understood. Here, we propose a new stochastic approach to investigate the molecular mechanisms of maintaining the cell sizes in bacteria. It is argued that the cell-size regulation is a result of coupling of two stochastic processes, cell growth and division, which eliminates the need for introducing the thresholds. Dynamic properties of the system are explicitly evaluated, and it is shown that the model is consistent with the experimentally supported adder principle of the cell-size regulation. In addition, theoretical predictions agree with experimental observations on E. coli bacteria.

Cellulose fibers are formed from close-packed single chains of cellulose that have been proposed to be formed by multimeric complexes (18 or more subunits) of the enzyme cellulose synthase, which exists in several isoforms. Purushotham et al. determined a cryo–electron microscopy structure of a trimer of a single isoform of cellulose synthase. A large channel forms a path for cellulose chains through the membrane-embedded complex. The structure also reveals oligomeric interfaces and provides a framework for modeling the larger complexes seen in plant membranes. The close arrangement of exit sites for nascent glycan chains is consistent with the enzyme complex playing a role in directing cellulose microfibril formation. Science, this issue p. 1089 The structure of a homotrimeric cellulose synthase complex provides molecular insights into cellulose fibril formation. Cellulose is an essential plant cell wall component and represents the most abundant biopolymer on Earth. Supramolecular plant cellulose synthase complexes organize multiple linear glucose polymers into microfibrils as load-bearing wall components. We determined the structure of a poplar cellulose synthase CesA homotrimer that suggests a molecular basis for cellulose microfibril formation. This complex, stabilized by cytosolic plant-conserved regions and helical exchange within the transmembrane segments, forms three channels occupied by nascent cellulose polymers. Secretion steers the polymers toward a common exit point, which could facilitate protofibril formation. CesA’s N-terminal domains assemble into a cytosolic stalk that interacts with a microtubule-tethering protein and may thus be involved in CesA localization.

Social structures arise naturally from our advection-diffusion-reaction model as self-reproducing Turing patterns. We computationally study the effects of fluid advection on these patterns as a mechanism to enable or enhance social behavior. Our central finding is that flow shear enables and promotes social behavior in microbes by increasing the group fragmentation rate and thereby limiting the spread of cheating strains.

In the Mojave Desert, these organisms find refuge from intense solar radiation under milky quartz where moisture persists for a longer period of time than in adjacent soil surface habitat. Desert mosses, which are extremely desiccation-tolerant, can also occur in these hypolithic spaces, though little is known about this unique moss microhabitat and how species composition compares to that of adjacent soil surface communities. To address this question, we deployed microclimate dataloggers and collected moss samples from under and adjacent to 18 milky quartz rocks (quartz mean center thickness 26 ± 15 mm) in a western high elevation Mojave Desert site. Light transmission through Mojave quartz rocks may be as low as 1.2%, and data from microclimate loggers deployed for five months support the hypothesis that quartz provides thermal buffering and higher relative humidity compared to the soil surface. Of the 53 samples collected from hypolith and surface microhabitats, 68% were Syntrichia caninervis, the dominant bryophyte of the Mojave Desert biological soil crust. Tortula inermis accounted for 28% of the samples and 4% were Bryum argenteum. In a comparison of moss community composition, we found that S. caninervis was more likely to be on the soil surface, though it was abundant in both microhabitats, while T. inermis was more restricted to hypoliths, perhaps due to protection from temperature extremes. In our study site, the differences between hypolithic and surface microhabitats enable niche partitioning between T. inermis and S. caninervis, enhancing alpha diversity. This work points to the need to thoroughly consider microhabitats when assessing bryophyte species diversity and modelling species distributions.

BC is an important component of the global carbon cycle because, compared to unburned biogenic OC, it is selectively conserved in terrestrial and oceanic pools. Here we show that the dissolved BC (DBC) content of dissolved OC (DOC) is twice greater in major (sub)tropical and high-latitude rivers than in major temperate rivers, with further significant differences between biomes. We estimate that rivers export 18 ± 4 Tg DBC year −1 globally and that, including particulate BC fluxes, total riverine export amounts to 43 ± 15 Tg BC year −1 (12 ± 5% of the OC flux). While rivers export ~1% of the OC sequestered by terrestrial vegetation, our estimates suggest that 34 ± 26% of the BC produced by landscape fires has an oceanic fate. Biogeochemical models require modification to account for the unique dynamics of BC and to predict the response of recalcitrant OC export to changing environmental conditions. Black carbon is a recalcitrant and unique form of organic carbon formed from incomplete combustion. Here the authors use global sampling to reduce uncertainty in the flux of terrestrial black carbon to the oceans, predicting that 34% of black carbon produced by fires has an oceanic fate.",0.008312295,0.005564281,0.005124582,0.010588727,0.005061401,0.003658385,0.003013903,0.05727224,0.008813934,0.00518809,0.023178266,0.023267815,0.26667595,0.008220898,0.00576049,0.002545379,0.00380334,0.009150286,0.012713727,0.005511793,0.004987861,0.003579191,0.008789226,0.006016788,0.007794441,0.005337863,0.004374272,0.008925178,0.004579669,"['bee', 'flies', 'dandelion', 'syrphidae', 'bees', 'diptera']","[0.044943820224719, 0.033707865168539006, 0.022471910112359002, 0.011235955056179001, 0.044943820224719, 0.011235955056179001]","[1.0, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25, 1.0, 0.25]"

Ice-nucleating organisms play important roles in the environment. With their ability to induce ice formation at temperatures just below the ice melting point, bacteria such as Pseudomonas syringae attack plants through frost damage using specialized ice-nucleating proteins. Besides the impact on agriculture and microbial ecology, airborne P. syringae can affect atmospheric glaciation processes, with consequences for cloud evolution, precipitation, and climate. Biogenic ice nucleation is also relevant for artificial snow production and for biomimetic materials for controlled interfacial freezing. We use interface-specific sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy to show that hydrogen bonding at the water-bacteria contact imposes structural ordering on the adjacent water network. Experimental SFG data and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that ice-active sites within P. syringae feature unique hydrophilic-hydrophobic patterns to enhance ice nucleation.

The results of the tear–blood serum relationship and the comparison to human tear components showed particularities that are potentially derived from a homeostatic response to the environment.

Flagellar waves are generated by thousands of asymmetric molecular components; yet, paradoxically, forward swimming arises via symmetric side-to-side flagellar movement. This led to the preponderance of symmetric flagellar control hypotheses. However, molecular asymmetries must still dictate the flagellum and be manifested in the beat. Here, we reconcile molecular and microscopic observations, reconnecting structure to function, by showing that human sperm uses asymmetric and anisotropic controls to swim. High-speed three-dimensional (3D) microscopy revealed two coactive transversal controls: An asymmetric traveling wave creates a one-sided stroke, and a pulsating standing wave rotates the sperm to move equally on all sides. Symmetry is thus achieved through asymmetry, creating the optical illusion of bilateral symmetry in 2D microscopy. This shows that the sperm flagellum is asymmetrically controlled and anisotropically regularized by fast-signal transduction. This enables the sperm to swim forward.",0.038847197,0.011059288,0.019648941,0.01898114,0.016291196,0.8230806,0.007764201,0.014417756,0.25346464,0.67694956,0.024156531,0.042012874,0.015121373,0.0107442,0.028490636,0.00911321,0.012915238,0.016438637,0.025167773,0.17026371,0.015211125,0.015850024,0.019746274,0.038705766,0.014307485,0.02227872,0.012372744,0.04320303,0.04963797,"['honey bee', 'bee']","[0.04, 0.06]","[0.6666666666666661, 1.0]"

Since these parasites readily develop drug resistance, development of new, effective drugs to treat infection caused by these parasites is an ongoing challenge for the medical and veterinary communities. We hypothesized that invertebrate-bacterial symbioses might be a rich source of anti-apicomplexan compounds because invertebrates are susceptible to infections with gregarines, parasites that are ancestral to all apicomplexans. We chose to explore the therapeutic potential of shipworm symbiotic bacteria as they are bona fide symbionts, are easily grown in axenic culture and have genomes rich in secondary metabolite loci [1,2]. Two strains of the shipworm symbiotic bacterium, Teredinibacter turnerae, were screened for activity against Toxoplasma gondii and one strain, T7901, exhibited activity against intracellular stages of the parasite. Bioassay-guided fractionation identified tartrolon E (trtE) as the source of the activity. TrtE has an EC50 of 3 nM against T. gondii, acts directly on the parasite itself and kills the parasites after two hours of treatment. TrtE exhibits nanomolar to picomolar level activity against Cryptosporidium, Plasmodium, Babesia, Theileria, and Sarcocystis; parasites representing all branches of the apicomplexan phylogenetic tree. The compound also proved effective against Cryptosporidium parvum infection in neonatal mice, indicating that trtE may be a potential lead compound for preclinical development.

Transparency and mirrored surfaces-common camouflage strategies under the diffuse solar illumination of shallower waters-are conspicuous when illuminated by directed bioluminescent sources due to reflection from the body surface [5, 6]. Pigmentation allows animals to absorb light from bioluminescent sources, rendering them visually undetectable against the dark background of the deep sea [5]. We present evidence suggesting pressure to reduce reflected bioluminescence led to the evolution of ultra-black skin (reflectance <0.5%) in 16 species of deep-sea fishes across seven distantly related orders. Histological data suggest this low reflectance is mediated by a continuous layer of densely packed melanosomes in the exterior-most layer of the dermis [7, 8] and that this layer lacks the unpigmented gaps between pigment cells found in other darkly colored fishes [9-13]. Using finite-difference, time-domain modeling and comparisons with melanosomes found in other ectothermic vertebrates [11, 13-21], we find the melanosomes making up the layer in these ultra-black species are optimized in size and shape to minimize reflectance. Low reflectance results from melanosomes scattering light within the layer, increasing the optical path length and therefore light absorption by the melanin. By reducing reflectance, ultra-black fish can reduce the sighting distance of visual predators more than 6-fold compared to fish with 2% reflectance. This biological example of efficient light absorption via a simple architecture of strongly absorbing and highly scattering particles may inspire new ultra-black materials.",0.013323392,0.069824435,0.005156332,0.009625994,0.009051611,0.008979656,0.00430115,0.007841119,0.008452134,0.010126444,0.005748865,0.006519929,0.009701153,0.008047853,0.006561383,0.004951008,0.006794664,0.63236415,0.008657783,0.010058853,0.012078084,0.010377716,0.02979523,0.006345797,0.007615911,0.006515937,0.008026146,0.011934529,0.008320593,"['mouse', 'zeta', 'mice', 'respiratory syncytial virus']","[0.011363636363636001, 0.011363636363636001, 0.011363636363636001, 0.0]","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0]"

The developmental defects in zebrafish, including lack of the ventral fin, induced by cercosporamide were strikingly similar to the phenotypes caused by renowned small-molecule BMPR type I kinase inhibitors and inactivating mutations in zebrafish BMPRs. In mammalian cell-based assays, cercosporamide blocked BMP/SMAD-dependent transcriptional reporter activity and BMP-induced SMAD1/5-phosphorylation. Biochemical assays with a panel of purified recombinant kinases demonstrated that cercosporamide directly inhibited kinase activity of type I BMPRs [also called activin receptor-like kinases (ALKs)]. In mammalian cells, cercosporamide selectively inhibited constitutively active BMPR type I-induced SMAD1/5 phosphorylation. Importantly, cercosporamide rescued the developmental defects caused by constitutively active Alk2 in zebrafish embryos. We believe that cercosporamide could be the first of a new class of molecules with potential to be developed further for clinical use against diseases that are causally linked to overactivation of BMPR signaling, including fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma.

Of these, certain papilionid butterflies have reflectances approaching 0.2%, resulting from a polydisperse honeycomb structure. It is unknown if other ultra-black butterflies use this mechanism. Here, we examine a phylogenetically diverse set of butterflies and demonstrate that other butterflies employ simpler nanostructures that achieve ultra-black coloration in scales thinner than synthetic alternatives. Using scanning electron microscopy, we find considerable interspecific variation in the geometry of the holes in the structures, and verify with finite-difference time-domain modeling that expanded trabeculae and ridges, found across ultra-black butterflies, reduce reflectance up to 16-fold. Our results demonstrate that butterflies produce ultra-black by creating a sparse material with high surface area to increase absorption and minimize surface reflection. We hypothesize that butterflies use ultra-black to increase the contrast of color signals. Nature has developed the ability to produce a wide range of optical effects most notably in the butterfly wing. Here, the authors report on the analysis of the structures responsible for ultra-black coloration across different butterflies and combine this with modelling to identify the key characteristics",0.012519765,0.013789403,0.006391333,0.006364198,0.014011477,0.011171471,0.00492011,0.008470405,0.013793587,0.013326056,0.007568715,0.006447965,0.011838213,0.009017437,0.009887093,0.007600178,0.010734576,0.8144244,0.010016928,0.012652786,0.015018367,0.010443937,0.011589319,0.014222018,0.010075556,0.009986177,0.011413732,0.015214641,0.006969747,"['mammoth', 'rhinoceros', 'woolly mammoth', 'woolly rhinoceros', 'humans', 'human', 'coelodonta antiquitatis']","[0.016129032258064002, 0.048387096774193006, 0.0, 0.0, 0.032258064516129004, 0.032258064516129004, 0.0]","[0.33333333333333304, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.6666666666666661, 0.6666666666666661, 0.0]"

We have observed that righting is achieved solely by performing a rolling manoeuvre. How flies manage to do this has not yet been elucidated. It was observed here for the first time that hoverfly reorientation is entirely achieved within 6 wingbeats (48.8 ms) at angular roll velocities of up to 10×103 deg s−1 and that the onset of their head rotation consistently follows that of their body rotation after a time lag of 16 ms. The insects' body roll was found to be triggered by the asymmetric wing stroke amplitude, as expected. The righting process starts immediately with the first wingbeat and seems unlikely to depend on visual feedback. A dynamic model for the fly's righting reflex is presented, which accounts for the head/body movements and the time lag recorded in these experiments. This model consists of a closed-loop control of the body roll, combined with a feedforward control of the head/body angle. During the righting manoeuvre, a strong coupling seems to exist between the activation of the halteres (which measure the body's angular speed) and the gaze stabilization reflex. These findings again confirm the fundamental role played by the halteres in both body and head stabilization processes. Summary: Hoverfly righting is achieved by performing a rolling manoeuvre; reorientation is achieved within 6 wingbeats and hoverfly head rotation follows that of their body after a time lag of 16 ms.",0.006784175,0.018064987,0.00934137,0.005758087,0.011329173,0.010950128,0.009675059,0.004998481,0.009454694,0.005445834,0.003688366,0.005496501,0.0128167,0.012544012,0.004103778,0.004032045,0.5922453,0.009112432,0.009185567,0.010625653,0.012627499,0.011030146,0.017549206,0.006440262,0.008122047,0.009696825,0.014371397,0.009496158,0.011926817,['mytilus edulis'],[0.013888888888888002],[1.0]

Here, we used Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) as the alpha-coronavirus model, and investigated the antiviral properties of curcumin against TGEV. Our results demonstrated that curcumin strongly inhibited TGEV proliferation and viral protein expression in a dose-dependent manner. We also observed that curcumin exhibited direct virucidal abilities in a dose-, temperature- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, time-of-addition assays showed that curcumin mainly acted in the early phase of TGEV replication. Notably, in an adsorption assay, curcumin at 40 µM resulted in a reduction in viral titres of 3.55 log TCID50 ml-1, indicating that curcumin possesses excellent inhibitory effects on the adsorption of TGEV. Collectively, we demonstrate for the first time that curcumin has virucidal activity and virtual inhibition against TGEV, suggesting that curcumin might be a candidate drug for effective control of TGEV infection.",0.012329602,0.004450883,0.005587588,0.006408256,0.005521913,0.003812429,0.003975212,0.008389751,0.007736966,0.00629794,0.038033765,0.05990265,0.004823428,0.008166473,0.003117508,0.009082325,0.004431002,0.004180023,0.028385721,0.004160349,0.004844828,0.009213962,0.011163988,0.010109261,0.004244545,0.41424316,0.003066175,0.011912609,0.003412416,"['bird', 'tetra', 'fish', 'birds', 'gymnocorymbus ternetzi', 'black tetra']","[0.010869565217391, 0.010869565217391, 0.05434782608695601, 0.010869565217391, 0.0, 0.0]","[0.2, 0.2, 1.0, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0]"

We investigate the evolution and genetic regulation of butterfly scale laminae, which are simple photonic nanostructures. In a lineage of buckeye butterflies artificially selected for blue wing color, we found that thickened laminae caused a color shift from brown to blue. Deletion of the optix patterning gene also altered color via lamina thickening, revealing shared regulation of pigments and lamina thickness. Finally, we show how lamina thickness variation contributes to the color diversity that distinguishes sexes and species throughout the genus Junonia. Thus, quantitatively tuning one dimension of scale architecture facilitates both the microevolution and macroevolution of a broad spectrum of hues. Because the lamina is an intrinsic component of typical butterfly scales, our findings suggest that tuning lamina thickness is an available mechanism to create structural color across the Lepidoptera.",0.012580476,0.012885049,0.007735732,0.007013758,0.018415907,0.012959989,0.005076746,0.01372341,0.029147092,0.014557849,0.010653757,0.008527748,0.015524412,0.007380563,0.011484193,0.007651502,0.010264973,0.8450423,0.009599741,0.015455736,0.018649423,0.011533291,0.012353518,0.019400751,0.008628473,0.011201203,0.009163733,0.011938718,0.007351402,"['bears', 'vertebrates', 'ramazzottius varieornatus', 'rays', 'bear', 'ray', 'plants', 'tardigrades', 'water bears', 'humans']","[0.008849557522123, 0.008849557522123, 0.008849557522123, 0.035398230088495006, 0.008849557522123, 0.035398230088495006, 0.008849557522123, 0.017699115044247, 0.008849557522123, 0.008849557522123]","[0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 1.0, 0.25, 1.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.25, 0.25]"

However, visual perception is challenged when adaptation is not fast enough to deal with sudden declines in overall illumination, for example, when gaze follows a moving object from bright sunlight into a shaded area. Here, we show that the visual system of the fly employs a solution by propagating a corrective luminance-sensitive signal. We use in vivo 2-photon imaging and behavioral analyses to demonstrate that distinct OFF-pathway inputs encode contrast and luminance. Predictions of contrast-sensitive neuronal responses show that contrast information alone cannot explain behavioral responses in sudden dim light. The luminance-sensitive pathway via the L3 neuron is required for visual processing in such rapidly changing light conditions, ensuring contrast constancy when pure contrast sensitivity underestimates a stimulus. Thus, retaining a peripheral feature, luminance, in visual processing is required for robust behavioral responses.",0.01008942,0.6401307,0.009843566,0.011352329,0.008871762,0.007771865,0.005468126,0.013721416,0.012370955,0.005401272,0.005259076,0.010608934,0.00831992,0.005676752,0.004450885,0.003558667,0.005626732,0.027125185,0.007011693,0.006589466,0.007028042,0.035159443,0.013010101,0.007918885,0.006306773,0.008718156,0.008278133,0.006639383,0.008733644,"['common swift', 'bird', 'swifts', 'birds', 'pallid swift', 'alpine swift']","[0.0, 0.013888888888888002, 0.11111111111111101, 0.013888888888888002, 0.0, 0.013888888888888002]","[0.0, 0.125, 1.0, 0.125, 0.0, 0.125]"

Using the largest dataset yet assembled, we show that maximum dive duration increases predictably with body mass in both ectotherms and endotherms. Compared to endotherms, ectotherms can remain submerged for longer, but the mass scaling relationship for dive duration is much steeper in endotherms than in ectotherms. These differences in diving allometry can be fully explained by inherent differences between the two groups in their metabolic rate and how metabolism scales with body mass and temperature. Therefore, we suggest that similar constraints on oxygen storage and usage have shaped the evolutionary ecology of diving in all air-breathing animals, irrespective of their evolutionary history and metabolic mode. The steeper scaling relationship between body mass and dive duration in endotherms not only helps explain why the largest extant vertebrate divers are endothermic rather than ectothermic, but also fits well with the emerging consensus that large extinct tetrapod divers (e.g. plesiosaurs, ichthyosaurs and mosasaurs) were endothermic.",0.010961795,0.005831059,0.012022067,0.002943498,0.096308194,0.2657908,0.02260033,0.009451348,0.3256289,0.005097187,0.016339866,0.005511989,0.007824187,0.003006665,0.007565124,0.02690864,0.025493233,0.009882006,0.005782988,0.030785564,0.019845204,0.005137858,0.42787084,0.006380151,0.006468542,0.009476131,0.006863593,0.004432225,0.014520724,[],[],[]

Characterization of polar benthic marine invertebrate-associated microbiomes is limited to few studies. This study was motivated by our interest in better understanding the microbiome structure and composition of the ascidian, Synoicum adareanum, in which palmerolide A (PalA), a bioactive macrolide with specificity against melanoma, was isolated. PalA bears structural resemblance to a hybrid nonribosomal peptide-polyketide that has similarities to microbially-produced macrolides. We conducted a spatial survey to assess both PalA levels and microbiome composition in S. adareanum in a region of the Antarctic Peninsula near Anvers Island (64°46′ S, 64°03′ W). PalA was ubiquitous and abundant across a collection of 21 ascidians (3 subsamples each) sampled from seven sites across the Anvers Island Archipelago. The microbiome composition (V3–V4 16S rRNA gene sequence variants) of these 63 samples revealed a core suite of 21 bacterial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs)—20 of which were distinct from regional bacterioplankton.

Although the optical properties of these nanostructures are well understood, their evolutionary history is not fully resolved, in part due to a poor knowledge of their fossil record. Here, we report three-dimensional photonic nanostructures preserved in brightly coloured scales of two weevils, belonging to the genus Phyllobius or Polydrusus, from the Pleistocene (16–10 ka) of Switzerland. The scales display vibrant blue, green and yellow hues that resemble those of extant Phyllobius/Polydrusus. Scanning electron microscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering analyses reveal that the subfossil scales possess a single-diamond photonic crystal nanostructure. In extant Phyllobius/Polydrusus, the near-angle-independent blue and green hues function primarily in crypsis. The preservation of far-field, angle-independent structural colours in the Swiss subfossil weevils and their likely function in substrate matching confirm the importance of investigating fossil and subfossil photonic nanostructures to understand the evolutionary origins and diversification of colours and associated behaviours (e.g. crypsis) in insects.",0.015314206,0.014708663,0.008400519,0.006836958,0.009477495,0.008560026,0.005261149,0.009287,0.009938464,0.01751401,0.006181388,0.007399718,0.010744834,0.007857193,0.00849713,0.007199314,0.007962361,0.79214996,0.008698304,0.015674805,0.013661545,0.012163792,0.010171746,0.02115032,0.008347797,0.010819429,0.00879704,0.01652844,0.013356687,['beetles'],[0.02],[1.0]

Slight shifts in arrangement within biological photonic nanostructures can produce large color differences, and sexual selection often leads to high color diversity in clades with structural colors. We use phylogenetic reconstruction, electron microscopy, spectrophotometry, and optical modeling to show an opposing pattern of nanostructural diversification accompanied by unusual conservation of blue color in tarantulas (Araneae: Theraphosidae). In contrast to other clades, blue coloration in phylogenetically distant tarantulas peaks within a narrow 20-nm region around 450 nm. Both quasi-ordered and multilayer nanostructures found in different tarantulas produce this blue color. Thus, even within monophyletic lineages, tarantulas have evolved strikingly similar blue coloration through divergent mechanisms. The poor color perception and lack of conspicuous display during courtship of tarantulas argue that these colors are not sexually selected.

However, these components do not account for the vivid blue-green colors of hundreds of species of frogs with sparse chromatophores. Our study shows that green coloration originates in proteins of the serpin superfamily that bind the pigment biliverdin, modulating its absorbance properties. Using a South American treefrog, we demonstrated that these serpins have a clear ecological role in modulating the reflectance properties and rendering animals cryptic in the foliage even in the near-infrared portion of the spectrum. These findings open up exciting research perspectives both in biochemistry and evolution of serpins, as well as in the study of extracellular protein-mediated coloration in vertebrates. Many vertebrates have distinctive blue-green bones and other tissues due to unusually high biliverdin concentrations—a phenomenon called chlorosis. Despite its prevalence, the biochemical basis, biology, and evolution of chlorosis are poorly understood. In this study, we show that the occurrence of high biliverdin in anurans (frogs and toads) has evolved multiple times during their evolutionary history, and relies on the same mechanism—the presence of a class of serpin family proteins that bind biliverdin. Using a diverse combination of techniques, we purified these serpins from several species of nonmodel treefrogs and developed a pipeline that allowed us to assemble their complete amino acid and nucleotide sequences. The described proteins, hereafter named biliverdin-binding serpins (BBS), have absorption spectra that mimic those of phytochromes and bacteriophytochromes. Our models showed that physiological concentration of BBSs fine-tune the color of the animals, providing the physiological basis for crypsis in green foliage even under near-infrared light. Additionally, we found that these BBSs are most similar to human glycoprotein alpha-1-antitrypsin, but with a remarkable functional diversification. Our results present molecular and functional evidence of recurrent evolution of chlorosis, describe a biliverdin-binding protein in vertebrates, and introduce a function for a member of the serpin superfamily, the largest and most ubiquitous group of protease inhibitors.",0.01735521,0.01669364,0.006486712,0.008257864,0.01266922,0.00876304,0.004340708,0.0103436,0.01575302,0.016566612,0.010577084,0.009213252,0.015233479,0.008652355,0.010713532,0.008576042,0.007037466,0.84211564,0.012305561,0.015667936,0.01504316,0.010260779,0.014930183,0.010354345,0.008656814,0.010790765,0.008210008,0.014585676,0.006823364,['ruellia ciliatiflora'],[0.024390243902439],[1.0]

The levels of mRNAs are tightly regulated, in part by controlling their half-lives. In eukaryotic cells, mRNA half-life is largely linked to translational efficiency, but the mechanism underlying this link has remained elusive. Buschauer et al. used cryo–electron microscopy and RNA sequencing to show how a key regulator of mRNA degradation, the Ccr4-Not complex, monitors the ribosome during mRNA translation. They found that the Not5 subunit directly binds to a ribosomal site exposed specifically during inefficient decoding, thereby triggering mRNA degradation. Analysis of mutants revealed the importance of this sensing mechanism for mRNA homeostasis. Science, this issue p. eaay6912 A protein complex binds to ribosomes that lack bound tRNAs, thus connecting translation elongation problems and mRNA decay. INTRODUCTION The tightly controlled process of gene expression requires messenger RNAs (mRNAs), which represent DNA-derived blueprints for polypeptides, to be translated by the protein-producing machinery of the cell, the ribosomes. Therefore, protein levels depend largely on cellular mRNA levels, and the control of mRNA decay is one of the most critical processes for setting the overall level of gene expression. Half-lives of mRNAs vary greatly between different transcripts, and regulation of the mRNA decay rate is intimately connected to the elongation phase of mRNA translation. To that end, codon optimality has been established as a key parameter for determining mRNA half-life in multiple eukaryotic organisms. It has also been established that the timely decay of short-lived mRNAs enriched with nonoptimal codons requires the Ccr4-Not complex. Ccr4-Not is an essential protein complex, with its best understood role in mRNA degradation, where it serves as the major cytoplasmic 3′-poly(A)-tail deadenylase that initiates decay of most mRNAs. By deadenylation and subsequent activation of the mRNA decapping machinery, the Ccr4-Not complex renders mRNAs accessible to the major degrading exonucleases, such as Xrn1 on the 5′ end and the exosome on the 3′ end. The molecular mechanism underlying codon optimality monitoring and coordination with mRNA decay by the Ccr4-Not complex has remained elusive. RATIONALE Because nonoptimal codons affect decoding kinetics of the ribosome and mRNA degradation occurs largely cotranslationally, it is highly plausible that codon optimality is directly monitored on the ribosome. In addition, a direct physical link between the participating Ccr4-Not complex and the ribosome has been suggested previously, and the Not4 subunit of the complex, an E3 ligase, ubiquitinates the eS7 protein of the 40S ribosomal subunit in yeast. Therefore, we set out to gain insights into the connection between the Ccr4-Not complex and the translation machinery in the context of mRNA homeostasis by combining cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM), ribosome profiling, and biochemical analysis. RESULTS We used affinity-purified native Ccr4-Not–ribosome complexes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae for analysis by cryo-EM and found that recruitment of Ccr4-Not to the ribosome occurs via the Not5 subunit. The N terminus of Not5—in particular, a three α-helix bundle—interacted specifically with the ribosomal E-site, and deletion of the Not5 N-terminus resulted in the loss of stable ribosome association of the Ccr4-Not complex. However, ubiquitination of the small ribosomal subunit protein eS7 through the Not4 subunit still occurred. The Not5 interaction involved the ribosomal protein eS25 of the small subunit, in addition to transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs). We found that Ccr4-Not interacts with both initiating and elongating ribosomes. In either case, Not5 engaged the E-site only when the ribosome adopted a distinct conformation lacking accommodated tRNA in the A-site, indicative of impaired decoding kinetics. Ribosome profiling revealed that low-optimality codons were enriched in the A-site in the Ccr4-Not–bound elongating ribosomes. This observation explained the low A-site tRNA occupancy observed with cryo-EM and suggested a link to codon optimality monitoring. Consistently, using mRNA stability assays, we found that loss of Not5 resulted in the inability of the mRNA degradation machinery to sense codon optimality. The observed dysregulation of mRNA half-life was detected upon Not5 deletion, Not5 N-terminal deletion, eS25 deletion, and loss of eS7 ubiquitination by Not4, which apparently serves as an upstream prerequisite for further Ccr4-Not activity on the ribosome. In addition, mRNA decapping was found to be impaired in these mutants, which confirmed that, in this pathway, Ccr4-Not triggers decapping downstream of optimality monitoring. CONCLUSION Our analysis elucidates a direct physical link between the mRNA decay–mediating Ccr4-Not complex and the ribosome. Dependent on preceding ubiquitination of eS7 by the Not4 subunit, the Ccr4-Not complex binds (via the Not5 subunit) specifically to the ribosomal E-site when the A-site lacks tRNA because of slow decoding kinetics. This state of the ribosome occurs in the presence of nonoptimal codons in the A-site, which explains the shorter half-lives of transcripts enriched in nonoptimal codons. Thus, our findings provide mechanistic insights into the coordination of translation efficiency with mRNA stability through the Ccr4-Not complex. Ccr4-Not couples translation efficiency to mRNA degradation. When ribosomes encounter nonoptimal codons, low decoding efficiency leads to an increased likelihood of dissociation of the E-site tRNA before the cognate tRNA is accommodated in the A-site. As a result, the ribosomal E-site adopts a specific conformation, which is recognized by the Ccr4-Not complex through the N-terminus of its Not5 subunit, eventually triggering mRNA degradation by Xrn1. Control of messenger RNA (mRNA) decay rate is intimately connected to translation elongation, but the spatial coordination of these events is poorly understood. The Ccr4-Not complex initiates mRNA decay through deadenylation and activation of decapping. We used a combination of cryo–electron microscopy, ribosome profiling, and mRNA stability assays to examine the recruitment of Ccr4-Not to the ribosome via specific interaction of the Not5 subunit with the ribosomal E-site in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This interaction occurred when the ribosome lacked accommodated A-site transfer RNA, indicative of low codon optimality. Loss of the interaction resulted in the inability of the mRNA degradation machinery to sense codon optimality. Our findings elucidate a physical link between the Ccr4-Not complex and the ribosome and provide mechanistic insight into the coupling of decoding efficiency with mRNA stability.",0.012121106,0.013353251,0.008819129,0.021317186,0.001869367,0.004510893,0.004744693,0.011143977,0.043949373,0.004882977,0.007918529,0.20121785,0.028244471,0.010582619,0.002803419,0.005450187,0.0114534,0.012062828,0.012379196,0.008761694,0.016542407,0.019364577,0.01818458,0.0136068,0.007059201,0.017989563,0.002553561,0.037084866,0.010677904,"['bee', 'honey bees', 'honey bee', 'apis mellifera', 'european honey bee', 'bees']","[0.08333333333333301, 0.016666666666666, 0.016666666666666, 0.0, 0.0, 0.08333333333333301]","[1.0, 0.2, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]"

White beetles Goliathus goliatus, which can survive in high-temperature-equatorial forests, may suggest undiscovered new physical mechanisms for thermoregulation. Their scales' whiteness is created by the exquisite shell/hollow cylinder structure with two thermoregulatory effects, contributing to a lower equilibrium temperature of elytra under direct sunlight. In the visible regime, they enhance the broadband omnidirectional reflection significantly by synergetic structural effects originating from the thin-film interference, Mie resonance and total reflection.

Here, we examined how juvenile male and female bottlenose dolphins navigate this vulnerable period. Specifically, we examined their grouping patterns, activity budget, network dynamics, and social associations in the absence of adults. We found that juveniles live in highly dynamic groups, with group composition changing every 10 min on average. Groups were generally segregated by sex, and segregation was driven by same-sex preference rather than opposite-sex avoidance. Juveniles formed strong associations with select individuals, especially kin and same-sex partners, and both sexes formed cliques with their preferred partners. Sex-specific strategies in the juvenile period reflected adult reproductive strategies, in which the exploration of potential social partners may be more important for males (which form long-term alliances in adulthood) than females (which preferentially associate with kin in adulthood). Females spent more time alone and were more focused on foraging than males, but still formed close same-sex associations, especially with kin. Males cast a wider social net than females, with strong same-sex associations and many male associates. Males engaged in more affiliative behavior than females. These results are consistent with the social bonds and skills hypothesis and suggest that delayed sexual maturity in species with relational social complexity may allow individuals to assess potential associates and explore a complex social landscape without the risks associated with sexual maturity (e.g., adult reproductive competition; inbreeding).",0.004821897,0.004327874,0.12284342,0.013378637,0.007419855,0.008401128,0.002275486,0.007241764,0.040475186,0.014533659,0.008925925,0.006313886,0.005053971,0.004111407,0.008918841,0.003816758,0.002883102,0.002494578,0.002805446,0.004185307,0.001573387,0.027534122,0.005354781,0.062007714,0.004079308,0.00442263,0.002730281,0.003415076,0.006336715,"['bacteria', 'e. coli']","[0.024390243902439, 0.024390243902439]","[1.0, 1.0]"

Diverse groups are likely to be less susceptible to invasion by noncooperating social cheats: First, competition repression resulting from character displacement may provide less of a selective advantage to cheating; second, cheats may trade off the ability to exploit cooperators that specialize in one type of resource against cooperators that specialize in another ; third, diverse communities of any kind may have higher invasion resistance because there are fewer resources available for an invader to use . Furthermore, diverse groups are likely to be more productive than clonal groups if a wider range of total resources are being used . We addressed these issues by using the cooperative trait of biofilm formation in Pseudomonas fluorescens. Character displacement through resource competition evolved within biofilms; productivity increased with increasing character displacement, and diverse biofilms were less susceptible to invasion by cheats.

One such trait is the cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) layer in insects. It protects against desiccation and provides communication signals, especially in social insects. CHC composition is highly diverse within and across species. To understand the adaptive value of this chemical diversity, we must understand how it affects biological functionality. So far, CHCs have received ample research attention, but their physical properties were little studied. We argue that these properties determine their biological functionality, and are vital to understanding how CHC composition affects their adaptive value. We investigated melting behaviour and viscosity of CHCs from 11 ant species using differential scanning calorimetry and a novel microrheological technique. CHCs began melting below −45°C, and often were entirely liquid only above 30°C. Thus, they formed a solid–liquid mixture under ambient conditions, which contrasts to previous assumptions of entirely solid layers in many species. This may be adaptive as only biphasic CHC layers ensure uniform coating of the insect body, which is necessary for waterproofing. CHC viscosity was mostly between 0.1 and 0.2 Pa s−1, thus similar to motor oils. Surprisingly, chemically different CHC profiles had similar viscosities, suggesting that a certain viscosity level is adaptive and ensures that communication signals can be perceived. With this study, we draw attention to the importance of studying the physics of CHC layers. Only by understanding how chemical and physical mechanisms enable CHC functionality can we understand the causes and consequences of CHC diversification. Summary: Cuticular hydrocarbons protect insects from desiccation and allow chemical communication, and contain both liquid and solid parts. This complex phase behaviour appears vital to ensure biological functioning.",0.012420743,0.006155492,0.009914179,0.00387292,0.007236486,0.005010731,0.015312953,0.006455794,0.016458493,0.007261998,0.0473389,0.016525783,0.010839927,0.006769212,0.008688532,0.82369095,0.004763536,0.008613842,0.01700297,0.011961053,0.008539614,0.005434064,0.39564314,0.007558261,0.011399468,0.009981958,0.006758199,0.085641816,0.010799824,"['ephydra', 'flies']","[0.013888888888888002, 0.097222222222222]","[0.14285714285714202, 1.0]"

Crab spiders (Thomisidae) are described as ambush predators that do not build webs, but nevertheless use silk for draglines, egg cases and assembling leaf-nests. A little-known exception is the Australian thomisid Saccodomus formivorus, which constructs a basket-like silk web of extraordinary dimensional stability and structural integrity that facilitates the capture of its ant prey. We examined the physical and chemical properties of this unusual web and revealed that the web threads comprise microfibers that are embedded within a biopolymeric matrix containing additionally longitudinally-oriented submicron fibers. We showed that the micro- and submicron fibers differ in their chemical composition and that the web threads show a remarkable lateral resilience compared with that of the major ampullate silk of a well-investigated orb weaver.

Their matrilineal structure has strongly influenced the thinking about social structure in less well-studied cetaceans, including beluga whales. In a cross-sectional study of group structure and kinship we found that belugas formed a limited number of distinct group types, consistently observed across populations and habitats. Certain behaviours were associated with group type, but group membership was often dynamic. MtDNA-microsatellite profiling combined with relatedness and network analysis revealed, contrary to predictions, that most social groupings were not predominantly organized around close maternal relatives. They comprised both kin and non-kin, many group members were paternal rather than maternal relatives, and unrelated adult males often traveled together. The evolutionary mechanisms that shape beluga societies are likely complex; fitness benefits may be achieved through reciprocity, mutualism and kin selection.

Spiny pollen has evolved independently in multiple entomophilous lineages. Sexual selection may act on exine traits that facilitate male mating success by influencing the transfer of pollen from the anther to the body of the pollinator, while natural selection acts to increase pollen survival. We postulated that relative to sexual congeners, apomictic dandelions undergo relaxed selection on traits associated with male mating success.


METHODS
We explored sexual selection on exine traits by measuring the propensity for Taraxacum spp. pollen to attach to hairs of flower-visiting bumblebees (Bombus spp.) or flies (Diptera: Syrphidae and Muscoidea) and assessed natural selection by testing whether pollen traits defend against consumption.


RESULTS
Pollen picked up by bumblebees exhibited a narrower subset of spine-spacing phenotypes, consistent with stabilizing selection. Flies picked up larger pollen from flowers than expected at random. Surveys of corbiculae (pollen basket) contents from foraging bumblebees and feces of flies showed that pollen grains consumed by both kinds of visitors are similar in spine characteristics and size to those produced by the donor. When bees visit inflorescences of apomictic T. officinale, they pick up pollen with spine-spacing phenotypes above the mean and shifted toward those of sexual T. ceratophorum.


CONCLUSIONS
We demonstrate that traits under sexual selection during pollen pickup vary among pollinators, while natural selection for pollen defense is nil in T. ceratophorum. In hybrid zones between apomictic and sexual dandelions, pollen traits place apomictic donors at a dispersal disadvantage, potentially reinforcing reproductive isolation.",0.032381095,0.007812074,0.006779476,0.01100516,0.005682773,0.00755677,0.006445253,0.017094834,0.11955697,0.06953715,0.01021384,0.848711,0.005772827,0.01666036,0.023956548,0.026715407,0.005146694,0.019915838,0.11883948,0.012763254,0.013714107,0.013393384,0.008621736,0.047538836,0.00680455,0.014020755,0.005958538,0.024104042,0.012883198,[],[],[]

This may be achieved through reductions in the allocation of energy for various purposes (e.g. thermoregulation, locomotion, etc.). We studied whether such trade-offs also include suppression of the innate immune response, by subjecting captive male Svalbard ptarmigan (Lagopus muta hyperborea) to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) during exposure to either mild temperature (0°C) or cold snaps (acute exposure to −20°C), in constant winter darkness when birds were in energy-conserving mode, and in constant daylight in spring. The innate immune response was mostly unaffected by temperature. However, energy expenditure was below baseline when birds were immune challenged in winter, but significantly above baseline in spring. This suggests that the energetic component of the innate immune response was reduced in winter, possibly contributing to energy conservation. Immunological parameters decreased (agglutination, lysis, bacteriostatic capacity) or did not change (haptoglobin/PIT54) after the challenge, and behavioural modifications (anorexia, mass loss) were lengthy (9 days). While we did not study the mechanisms explaining these weak, or slow, responses, it is tempting to speculate they may reflect the consequences of having evolved in an environment where pathogen transmission rate is presumably low for most of the year. This is an important consideration if climate change and increased exploitation of the Arctic would alter pathogen communities at a pace outwith counter-adaption in wildlife.

There is limited understanding of how stream ecosystems interact and possibly adapt to novel hydrodynamic conditions. Combining mathematical modelling with field data, we demonstrate that bio-physical feedback between plant growth and flow redistribution triggers spatial self-organization of in-channel vegetation that buffers for changed hydrological conditions. The interplay of vegetation growth and hydrodynamics results in a spatial separation of the stream into densely vegetated, low-flow zones divided by unvegetated channels of higher flow velocities. This self-organization process decouples both local flow velocities and water levels from the forcing effect of changing stream discharge. Field data from two lowland, baseflow-dominated streams support model predictions and highlight two important stream-level emergent properties: vegetation controls flow conveyance in fast-flowing channels throughout the annual growth cycle, and this buffering of discharge variations maintains water depths and wetted habitat for the stream community.

We present a biologically validated mathematical solution to this classic problem based on honey bee color vision. The observed spectral tuning of two simple ocellar photoreceptors in the honey bee allows for an optimal color constancy solution to different light environments, including standard CIE (Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage) illuminations, natural forest light, sunlight, or shade. The model is fully supported by a neural pathway potentially allowing for the transfer of spectral information originating from the ocellar photoreceptors to the centralized information processing regions in the brain and explains previously observed behavioral results. This solution to color constancy can be implemented into color imaging systems to enable accurate color interpretation. How can a pollinator, like the honey bee, perceive the same colors on visited flowers, despite continuous and rapid changes in ambient illumination and background color? A hundred years ago, von Kries proposed an elegant solution to this problem, color constancy, which is currently incorporated in many imaging and technological applications. However, empirical evidence on how this method can operate on animal brains remains tenuous. Our mathematical modeling proposes that the observed spectral tuning of simple ocellar photoreceptors in the honey bee allows for the necessary input for an optimal color constancy solution to most natural light environments. The model is fully supported by our detailed description of a neural pathway allowing for the integration of signals originating from the ocellar photoreceptors to the information processing regions in the bee brain. These findings reveal a neural implementation to the classic color constancy problem that can be easily translated into artificial color imaging systems.",0.013086622,0.079923354,0.004764758,0.010004173,0.009858054,0.007161822,0.004759962,0.017486243,0.008598284,0.009635695,0.007580519,0.008047525,0.015843421,0.008363155,0.006388848,0.003780588,0.005259288,0.5729503,0.008806317,0.007453338,0.010847394,0.012726398,0.02548804,0.00722595,0.007862648,0.008005963,0.007911587,0.008051184,0.007624262,"['vertebrates', 'plants']","[0.044117647058823005, 0.014705882352941001]","[1.0, 0.33333333333333304]"

The giant sequoia is native to the Sierra Nevada (USA), a region with regular rockfalls. It is thus regularly exposed to high-energy impacts, with its bark playing a major protective role, as can be seen in the wild and has been proven in laboratory experiments. The authors quantify the fundamental biomechanical properties of the bark at various length scales, taking into account its hierarchical setup ranging from the integral level (whole bark) down to single bark fibers. Microtensile tests on single fibers and fiber pairs give insights into the properties of single fibers as well as the benefits of the strong longitudinal interconnection between single fibers arranged in pairs. Going beyond the level of single fibers or fiber pairs, towards the integral level, quasistatic compression tests and dynamic impact tests are performed on samples comprising the whole bark (inner and outer bark). These tests elucidate the deformation behavior under quasistatic compression and dynamic impact relevant for the high energy dissipation and impact-damping behavior of the bark. The remarkable energy dissipation capability of the bark at the abovementioned hierarchical levels are linked to the layered and fibrous structure of the bark structurally analyzed by thin sections and SEM and µCT scans.",0.004479088,0.006608753,0.005573037,0.002690611,0.5977814,0.006451541,0.02519498,0.006765142,0.007589414,0.003997013,0.005230149,0.002612128,0.008930317,0.005046556,0.010302202,0.005094911,0.009729409,0.004468777,0.005628685,0.004954691,0.030532494,0.006855316,0.005228249,0.006713062,0.042807262,0.007931658,0.25717154,0.004579532,0.007528741,['insects'],[0.022222222222222],[1.0]

Pulmonary infection by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a large burden on human health, for which there are few therapeutic options 1 . RSV targets ciliated epithelial cells in the airways, but how viruses such as RSV interact with receptors on these cells is not understood. Nucleolin is an entry coreceptor for RSV 2 and also mediates the cellular entry of influenza, the parainfluenza virus, some enteroviruses and the bacterium that causes tularaemia 3 , 4 . Here we show a mechanism of RSV entry into cells in which outside-in signalling, involving binding of the prefusion RSV-F glycoprotein with the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor, triggers the activation of protein kinase C zeta (PKCζ). This cellular signalling cascade recruits nucleolin from the nuclei of cells to the plasma membrane, where it also binds to RSV-F on virions. We find that inhibiting PKCζ activation prevents the trafficking of nucleolin to RSV particles on airway organoid cultures, and reduces viral replication and pathology in RSV-infected mice. These findings reveal a mechanism of virus entry in which receptor engagement and signal transduction bring the coreceptor to viral particles at the cell surface, and could form the basis of new therapeutics to treat RSV infection. Respiratory syncytial virus enters cells by binding to cell-surface IGFR1, which activates PKCζ and induces trafficking of the NCL coreceptor to the RSV particles at the cell surface.",0.013840621,0.008688614,0.005042543,0.012188671,0.006430421,0.004711788,0.004571442,0.013197176,0.008204795,0.009367556,0.013466837,0.107610814,0.008437656,0.013579595,0.007603915,0.006840599,0.00610851,0.005845567,0.01687218,0.006048563,0.005372128,0.015181277,0.004462343,0.016481634,0.007288881,0.6845928,0.004312853,0.012218171,0.004060074,['salmonids'],[0.11111111111111101],[1.0]

It remains elusive what the corresponding mechanism is in inviscid quantum fluids such as Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). Here we report our theoretical study of an initially static BEC merging with a rotating BEC in three-dimensional space along the rotational axis. We show that a solitonlike sheet, resembling a corkscrew, spontaneously emerges at the interface. Rapid angular-momentum transfer at a constant rate universally proportional to the initial angular-momentum density is observed. Strikingly, this transfer does not necessarily involve fluid advection or drifting of the quantized vortices. We reveal that the corkscrew structure can exert a torque that directly creates angular momentum in the static BEC and annihilates angular momentum in the rotating BEC. Uncovering this intriguing angular-momentum transport mechanism may benefit our understanding of various coherent matter-wave systems, spanning from atomtronics on chips to dark matter BECs at cosmic scales.",0.018455332,0.013588137,0.005926312,0.004080178,0.005028595,0.017515497,0.001730856,0.008119562,0.002826352,0.008420718,0.005178297,0.009804617,0.002302243,0.004488719,0.002526272,0.002415231,0.004212008,0.007651144,0.029588662,0.019050913,0.005205724,0.006145281,0.016933907,0.014882996,0.003608001,0.003644799,0.003072405,0.004100159,0.0045614,['snakes'],[0.053571428571428006],[1.0]

We attached custom-made “flight recorders” to Andean condors, the world’s heaviest soaring birds, documenting every single wingbeat and when and how individuals gained altitude. Remarkably, condors flapped for only 1% of their flight time, specifically during takeoff and when close to the ground. This is particularly striking as the birds were immature. Thus, our results demonstrate that even inexperienced birds can cover vast distances over land without flapping. Overall, this can help explain how extinct birds with twice the wingspan of condors could have flown. Flight costs are predicted to vary with environmental conditions, and this should ultimately determine the movement capacity and distributions of large soaring birds. Despite this, little is known about how flight effort varies with environmental parameters. We deployed bio-logging devices on the world’s heaviest soaring bird, the Andean condor (Vultur gryphus), to assess the extent to which these birds can operate without resorting to powered flight. Our records of individual wingbeats in >216 h of flight show that condors can sustain soaring across a wide range of wind and thermal conditions, flapping for only 1% of their flight time. This is among the very lowest estimated movement costs in vertebrates. One bird even flew for >5 h without flapping, covering ∼172 km. Overall, > 75% of flapping flight was associated with takeoffs. Movement between weak thermal updrafts at the start of the day also imposed a metabolic cost, with birds flapping toward the end of glides to reach ephemeral thermal updrafts. Nonetheless, the investment required was still remarkably low, and even in winter conditions with weak thermals, condors are only predicted to flap for ∼2 s per kilometer. Therefore, the overall flight effort in the largest soaring birds appears to be constrained by the requirements for takeoff.",0.016849842,0.014244786,0.028381098,0.006972757,0.026273994,0.04067056,0.018789748,0.00529124,0.014191367,0.006841716,0.004951764,0.005441071,0.013502074,0.01625428,0.009583516,0.004743511,0.8086178,0.010497454,0.011545823,0.0216878,0.019440515,0.01745586,0.036363814,0.010071211,0.006786511,0.009963471,0.005335535,0.004100406,0.0177775,[],[],[]

Discrete flight polyphenisms include winged and wingless morphs, whereas continuous flight polyphenisms can take the form of short- or long-distance fliers. The mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) exhibits polyphenic variation in flight distance but the consequences of this flight variation on life history strategies of beetles is unknown. This study assessed the effect of flight on two particular aspects of beetle biology: (1) an energetic trade-off between flight distance and host colonisation capacity; and (2) the relationship between flight distance and pheromone production. A 23 h flight treatment was applied to a subset of beetles using computer-linked flight mills. After flight treatment, both flown and unflown (control) beetles were given the opportunity to colonise bolts of host trees, and beetles that entered hosts were aerated to collect pheromone. A trade-off occurred between initiation of host colonisation and percentage body mass lost during flight, which indicates energy use during flight affects host acceptance in female mountain pine beetles. Furthermore, production of the aggregation pheromone trans-verbenol by female beetles was influenced by both percentage body mass lost during flight and flight distance. Male production of exo-brevicomin was affected by beetle condition following flight but not by the energy used during flight. These novel results give new insight into the polyphenic flight behaviour of mountain pine beetles. Flight variation is adaptive by acting to maintain population levels through safe and risky host colonisation strategies. These findings suggest mechanisms that facilitate the extremities of the continuous flight polyphenism spectrum. These opposing mechanisms appear to maintain the high variation in flight exhibited by this species.

However, few studies have used complete ancient genomes to examine species responses to climate change prior to extinction. The woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis) was a cold-adapted megaherbivore widely distributed across northern Eurasia during the Late Pleistocene and became extinct approximately 14 thousand years before present (ka BP). While humans and climate change have been proposed as potential causes of extinction [1-3], knowledge is limited on how the woolly rhinoceros was impacted by human arrival and climatic fluctuations [2]. Here, we use one complete nuclear genome and 14 mitogenomes to investigate the demographic history of woolly rhinoceros leading up to its extinction. Unlike other northern megafauna, the effective population size of woolly rhinoceros likely increased at 29.7 ka BP and subsequently remained stable until close to the species' extinction. Analysis of the nuclear genome from a ∼18.5-ka-old specimen did not indicate any increased inbreeding or reduced genetic diversity, suggesting that the population size remained steady for more than 13 ka following the arrival of humans [4]. The population contraction leading to extinction of the woolly rhinoceros may have thus been sudden and mostly driven by rapid warming in the Bølling-Allerød interstadial. Furthermore, we identify woolly rhinoceros-specific adaptations to arctic climate, similar to those of the woolly mammoth. This study highlights how species respond differently to climatic fluctuations and further illustrates the potential of palaeogenomics to study the evolutionary history of extinct species.",0.007523776,0.00332001,0.025532307,0.002863238,0.004616173,0.005191646,0.003296995,0.005175174,0.013758196,0.003636289,0.005865894,0.008841386,0.003694276,0.003126602,0.001521705,0.005084413,0.002647908,0.004609222,0.00863476,0.002828707,0.007004587,0.005700791,0.1470484,0.002588626,0.00269259,0.004493371,0.0018142,0.003031454,0.008930169,"['bees', 'proteaceae', 'bee', 'conospermum undulatum']","[0.020408163265306003, 0.010204081632653001, 0.020408163265306003, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.0]"

For birds flocks, insect swarms, and fish schools, group behavior can provide a mechanism for defense against predators, better foraging and mating capabilities and increased hydro/aerodynamic efficiency in long-distance migration events. Although collective motion has received much scientific attention, more work is required to model and understand the mechanisms responsible for school initiation and formation, and information transfer within these groups. Here we investigate schooling of Black Tetra (Gymnocorymbus ternetzi) fish triggered by startle stimuli in the form of approaching objects. High-speed video and tagging techniques were used to track the school and individual members. We then measured several variables including reaction times, group formation shapes, fish velocity, group density, and leadership within the group. These data reveal three things: 1) information propagates through the group as a wave, indicating that each fish is not reacting individually to the stimulus, 2) the time taken for information to transfer across the group is independent of group density, and 3) information propagates across large groups faster than would be expected if the fish were simply responding to the motion of their nearest neighbor. A model was then built wherein simulated fish have a simple `stimuli/escape' vector based on a hypothetical field of vision. The model was used to simulate a group of individual fish with initial conditions, size, and stimuli similar to the biological experiments.

The tardigrade Ramazzottius varieornatus contains a unique nuclear protein termed Dsup, for damage suppressor, which can increase the resistance of human cells to DNA damage under conditions, such as ionizing radiation or hydrogen peroxide treatment, that generate hydroxyl radicals. Here we find that R. varieornatus Dsup is a nucleosome-binding protein that protects chromatin from hydroxyl radicals. Moreover, a Dsup ortholog from the tardigrade Hypsibius exemplaris similarly binds to nucleosomes and protects DNA from hydroxyl radicals. Strikingly, a conserved region in Dsup proteins exhibits sequence similarity to the nucleosome-binding domain of vertebrate HMGN proteins and is functionally important for nucleosome binding and hydroxyl radical protection. These findings suggest that Dsup promotes the survival of tardigrades under diverse conditions by a direct mechanism that involves binding to nucleosomes and protecting chromosomal DNA from hydroxyl radicals.",0.009790771,0.007049084,0.00737858,0.01289849,0.009665929,0.010281311,0.01062605,0.008688467,0.02295928,0.005127486,0.6513765,0.026194269,0.04115209,0.002605361,0.00548086,0.012062771,0.004177657,0.01138165,0.010720553,0.013694636,0.03908079,0.013316405,0.024919866,0.010675557,0.009777756,0.028765457,0.006807061,0.010408662,0.005485775,[],[],[]

 during the non-breeding period","Flight activity recorders have recently confirmed that alpine and common swifts spend the majority of their non-breeding period on the wing, which may last 6–10 months. Here we test the hypothesis that the closely related pallid swift, a species with a breeding distribution around the Mediterranean, lead a similar aerial life-style during its migration and wintering periods. The pallid swift usually lays two clutches in one season and therefore spends more time in the breeding area than the common swift. We successfully tracked four pallid swifts with data loggers that record light for geolocation and acceleration every 5 min to monitor flight activity. The birds wintered south of the Sahel in west Africa from the Ivory Coast to Cameroon. The pallid swifts spent the majority of their non-breeding time in flight, especially the first two months after leaving the breeding area in autumn, while a few landing events occurred during the winter. The total time grounded was < 1%, similar to that of the common and alpine swifts. The mass specific flight metabolic rate of swifts is similar to the average non-breeding metabolic rate of a long distance terrestrial migrant, suggesting swifts are not more likely to procure oxidative damage as a consequence of continuous flight than other migrants. The open airspace used by swifts may provide a relatively safe habitat that explain the high survival rate found in swifts.",0.02413304,0.005273714,0.12527087,0.003783608,0.006593325,0.015493184,0.007590254,0.00355189,0.017912546,0.004679197,0.003772051,0.004800602,0.004634429,0.004450331,0.002600741,0.007320505,0.025252558,0.004534898,0.005593884,0.008778366,0.00758029,0.010393551,0.14187801,0.005024169,0.003190546,0.003258256,0.001550085,0.003948701,0.012148978,['bacteria'],[0.02],[1.0]

Whilst knowledge of the factors that drive the evolution of interspecific variation in sperm morphology is accumulating, we currently have little understanding of factors that may constrain evolutionary change in sperm traits. We investigated whether susceptibility to sperm abnormalities could represent such a constraint in songbirds, a group characterized by a distinctive helical sperm head shape. Specifically, using 36 songbird species and data from light and scanning electron microscopy, we examined among‐species correlations between the occurrence of sperm head abnormalities and sperm morphology, as well as the correlation between sperm head abnormalities and two indicators of sperm competition. We found that species with more helically shaped sperm heads (i.e., a wider helical membrane and more pronounced cell waveform) had a higher percentage of abnormal sperm heads than species with less helical sperm (i.e., relatively straight sperm) and that sperm head traits were better predictors of head abnormalities than total sperm length. In contrast, there was no correlation between sperm abnormalities and the level of sperm competition. Given that songbird species with more pronounced helical sperm have higher average sperm swimming speed, our results suggest an evolutionary trade‐off between sperm performance and the structural integrity of the sperm head. As such, susceptibility to morphological abnormalities may constrain the evolution of helical sperm morphology in songbirds.",0.32232627,0.01289753,0.029889887,0.013467656,0.017571647,0.05366528,0.01134815,0.009695873,0.39744717,0.12458193,0.023622682,0.61298996,0.010511078,0.009480544,0.01221587,0.03610238,0.01287873,0.032218684,0.17322206,0.07387066,0.029735526,0.012340982,0.010850783,0.034178387,0.011139553,0.034324724,0.015485346,0.33509806,0.02022439,[],[],[]

The seals sense while swimming, hence their whiskers are sensitive enough to detect small-scale changes in the flow, while rejecting self-generated flow noise. Here we identify and illustrate a novel flow mechanism, causing a large-amplitude ‘slaloming’ whisker response, which allows artificial whiskers with the identical unique undulatory geometry as those of the harbour seal to detect the features of minute flow fluctuations when placed within wakes. Whereas in open water the whisker responds with very low-amplitude vibration, once within a wake, it oscillates with large amplitude and, importantly, its response frequency coincides with the Strouhal frequency of the upstream cylinder, making the detection of an upstream wake and an estimation of the size and shape of the wake-generating body possible. This mechanism has some similarities with the flow mechanisms observed in actively controlled propulsive foils within upstream wakes and trout swimming behind bluff cylinders in a stream, but there are also differences caused by the unique whisker morphology, which enables it to respond passively and within a much wider parametric range.",0.029057711,0.018002594,0.025070807,0.015626322,0.022590164,0.91635,0.01337352,0.009297562,0.05298115,0.022967454,0.01831474,0.010864978,0.018320944,0.017323684,0.01281421,0.007089493,0.22967376,0.012090319,0.007408868,0.5571904,0.010937699,0.023143621,0.030001894,0.028735826,0.017457234,0.015423191,0.014560401,0.009497929,0.025804676,['birds'],[0.019607843137254003],[1.0]

Small antifreeze proteins (AFPs) adsorb to particular facets of ice crystals, thus inhibiting their growth, whereas larger ice-nucleating proteins (INPs) can trigger the formation of new ice crystals at temperatures much higher than the homogeneous ice nucleation temperature of pure water. It has been proposed that both types of proteins interact similarly with ice and that, in principle, they may be able to exhibit both functions. Here we investigated two naturally occurring antifreeze proteins, one from fish, type-III AFP, and one from beetles, TmAFP.

However, the field is currently limited to several known electrochemically active microorganisms enriched and isolated in research laboratories. An alternative strategy is to enrich such microorganisms in their native environment by allowing them to exchange electrons with polarized solid electrodes. The use of this approach is currently limited because of a lack of available tools. We developed a low-cost, battery-operated potentiostat that is capable of controlling the potential of a working electrode and can be deployed and operated remotely, allowing the enrichment of microorganisms on electrodes in their native environment. The device was tested in four alkaline hot springs in Heart Lake Geyser Basin in Yellowstone National Park (with a temperature ranging from 45 οC to 91 οC and a relatively constant pH of 8.5–8.7). Microbial community analysis showed a change in microbial community structure after 32 days of polarization. The impact of polarization on microbial community was most substantial on the electrodes that generated the highest cathodic and anodic currents, suggesting a direct impact of polarization on electrode microbial community.",0.13478993,0.005696255,0.014162198,0.005483501,0.005851592,0.002410716,0.002174672,0.020649238,0.003202807,0.026323246,0.005799512,0.006994446,0.03095976,0.005908324,0.008121762,0.00347367,0.002488169,0.005939079,0.026937766,0.004256323,0.004545259,0.006256915,0.00371432,0.003246086,0.00458832,0.003751213,0.003286216,0.005479332,0.006061603,['neogonodactylus bredini'],[0.0],[0]

This stable backspin orientation minimizes the frontal area during flight, decreasing drag force on the seeds and thus increasing dispersal distance.

When the local air temperature exceeds a threshold, the nests are actively ventilated by bees fanning their wings at the nest entrance. Here, we show that colonies with relatively large nest entrances use an emergent ventilation strategy where fanning bees self-organize to form groups, separating regions of continuous inflow and outflow. The observed spatio-temporal patterns correlate the air velocity and air temperature along the entrances to the distribution of fanning bees. A mathematical model that couples these variables to known fanning behaviour of individuals recapitulates their collective dynamics. Additionally, the model makes predictions about the temporal stability of the fanning group as a function of the temperature difference between the environment and the nest. Consistent with these predictions, we observe that the fanning groups drift, cling to the entrance boundaries, break-up and reform as the ambient temperature varies over a period of days.

These taxa respond to light on the skin of their elongate hind‐bodies and tails by withdrawing under cover to avoid detection by predators. Here, we investigated tail phototaxis in sea snakes (Hydrophiinae), the only reptiles reported to exhibit this sensory behaviour. We conducted behavioural tests in 17 wild‐caught sea snakes of eight species by illuminating the dorsal surface of the tail and midbody skin using cold white, violet, blue, green and red light. Our results confirmed phototactic tail withdrawal in the previously studied Aipysurus laevis, revealed this trait for the first time in A. duboisii and A. tenuis, and suggested that tail photoreceptors have peak spectral sensitivities between blue and green light (457–514 nm). Based on these results, and an absence of photoresponses in five Aipysurus and Hydrophis species, we tentatively infer that tail phototaxis evolved in the ancestor of a clade of six Aipysurus species (comprising 10% of all sea snakes). Quantifying tail damage, we found that the probability of sustaining tail injuries was not influenced by tail phototactic ability in snakes. Gene profiling showed that transcriptomes of both tail skin and body skin lacked visual opsins but contained melanopsin (opn4x) in addition to key genes of the retinal regeneration and phototransduction cascades.

Many other vertebrates also harvest and feed on these seeds, however, and the roles of these animals as dispersers and establishers of whitebark pine has been uncertain. This work demonstrates that birds other than the nutcracker, rodents, and other mammals do not have the requisite behaviors to systematically disperse or establish whitebark pine, and that the pine is therefore dependent on the nutcracker for its regeneration.

The effect of different ions on complex superhydrophobic biological systems, however, has received little attention. By bringing together ecology, biomechanics, physics, and chemistry our study provides insight into the ion-specific effects of wetting in the presence of sodium carbonate and its large-scale consequences. By comparing the surface structure and chemistry of the alkali fly—an important food source for migrating birds—to other species we show that their uniquely hydrophobic properties arise from very small physical and chemical changes, thereby connecting picoscale physics with globally important ecological impacts. The remarkable alkali fly, Ephydra hians, deliberately crawls into the alkaline waters of Mono Lake to feed and lay eggs. These diving flies are protected by an air bubble that forms around their superhydrophobic cuticle upon entering the lake. To study the physical mechanisms underlying this process we measured the work required for flies to enter and leave various aqueous solutions. Our measurements show that it is more difficult for the flies to escape from Mono Lake water than from fresh water, due to the high concentration of Na2CO3 which causes water to penetrate and thus wet their setose cuticle. Other less kosmotropic salts do not have this effect, suggesting that the phenomenon is governed by Hofmeister effects as well as specific interactions between ion pairs. These effects likely create a small negative charge at the air–water interface, generating an electric double layer that facilitates wetting. Compared with six other species of flies, alkali flies are better able to resist wetting in a 0.5 M Na2CO3 solution. This trait arises from a combination of factors including a denser layer of setae on their cuticle and the prevalence of smaller cuticular hydrocarbons compared with other species. Although superbly adapted to resisting wetting, alkali flies are vulnerable to getting stuck in natural and artificial oils, including dimethicone, a common ingredient in sunscreen and other cosmetics. Mono Lake’s alkali flies are a compelling example of how the evolution of picoscale physical and chemical changes can allow an animal to occupy an entirely new ecological niche.",0.008457659,0.008823636,0.010560539,0.010229539,0.01541614,0.005323144,0.015307879,0.00775844,0.015835408,0.01755459,0.015544137,0.010718368,0.01703,0.007122818,0.007135492,0.093513176,0.00705045,0.008934572,0.011600494,0.010904446,0.01280367,0.004268778,0.026978035,0.008586804,0.015268949,0.017119119,0.029022153,0.8120669,0.01203102,"['insects', 'deinopis spinosa', 'spiders']","[0.011627906976744, 0.011627906976744, 0.034883720930232]","[0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304, 1.0]"

The family of topoisomerase proteins has independently evolved in different organisms to resolve these topological problems, yet no existing model can explain how topoisomerase alone can reduce the topological complexity of DNA in vivo. We propose that a synergistic mechanism between topoisomerase and a family of slip-link–like proteins called structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) can provide a pathway to systematically resolve topological entanglements even under physiological crowding and confinement. Given the ubiquity of topoisomerase and SMC, we argue that the uncovered mechanism is at work throughout the cell cycle and across different organisms. Topological entanglements severely interfere with important biological processes. For this reason, genomes must be kept unknotted and unlinked during most of a cell cycle. Type II topoisomerase (TopoII) enzymes play an important role in this process but the precise mechanisms yielding systematic disentanglement of DNA in vivo are not clear. Here we report computational evidence that structural-maintenance-of-chromosomes (SMC) proteins—such as cohesins and condensins—can cooperate with TopoII to establish a synergistic mechanism to resolve topological entanglements. SMC-driven loop extrusion (or diffusion) induces the spatial localization of essential crossings, in turn catalyzing the simplification of knots and links by TopoII enzymes even in crowded and confined conditions. The mechanism we uncover is universal in that it does not qualitatively depend on the specific substrate, whether DNA or chromatin, or on SMC processivity; we thus argue that this synergy may be at work across organisms and throughout the cell cycle.",0.05180274,0.008522545,0.7913477,0.007639607,0.014817462,0.008880584,0.01081525,0.053672362,0.1752976,0.015098885,0.02106668,0.052613538,0.017945273,0.007247042,0.02032252,0.014516337,0.008630912,0.004861624,0.012919878,0.014092086,0.009575422,0.010618022,0.006804801,0.60710466,0.011329825,0.019590791,0.004076304,0.00986665,0.020375105,"['fish', 'astyanax mexicanus', 'astyanax']","[0.037974683544303, 0.012658227848101, 0.012658227848101]","[1.0, 0.33333333333333304, 0.33333333333333304]"

A rich variety of righting strategies of beetle and turtle species have been described, but the exact role of the shell's geometry in righting is so far unknown. These strategies are often based on active mechanisms, e.g. most beetles self-right via motion of their legs or wings; flat, aquatic turtles use their muscular neck to flip back. On the other hand, highly domed, terrestrial turtles with short limbs and necks have virtually no active control: here shape itself may serve as a fundamental tool. Based on field data gathered on a broad spectrum of aquatic and terrestrial turtle species we develop a geometric model of the shell. Inspired by recent mathematical results, we demonstrate that a simple mechanical classification of the model is closely linked to the animals' righting strategy. Specifically, we show that the exact geometry of highly domed terrestrial species is close to optimal for self-righting, and the shell's shape is the predominant factor of their ability to flip back.

Self-powered actuation driven by ambient humidity is of practical interest for applications such as hygroscopic artificial muscles. We demonstrate that spider dragline silk exhibits a humidity-induced torsional deformation of more than 300°/mm. When the relative humidity reaches a threshold of about 70%, the dragline silk starts to generate a large twist deformation independent of spider species. The torsional actuation can be precisely controlled by regulating the relative humidity. The behavior of humidity-induced twist is related to the supercontraction behavior of spider dragline silk. Specifically, molecular simulations of MaSp1 and MaSp2 proteins in dragline silk reveal that the unique torsional property originates from the presence of proline in MaSp2. The large proline rings also contribute to steric exclusion and disruption of hydrogen bonding in the molecule. This property of dragline silk and its structural origin can inspire novel design of torsional actuators or artificial muscles and enable the development of designer biomaterials.",0.007583185,0.015879536,0.007494465,0.007670704,0.15533847,0.008429107,0.022509342,0.007706626,0.006657676,0.021951027,0.00748646,0.007036317,0.010671257,0.009767582,0.00685035,0.018232888,0.011200902,0.007366422,0.006280173,0.010895604,0.022320515,0.004104415,0.021982273,0.006499868,0.30787882,0.010151329,0.57935166,0.28633693,0.037791096,['red algae'],[0.0],[0]

Those tips, respectively fine ($\alpha$α) or coarse ($ \beta$β) have opposite molecular orientations. The $\alpha$α-pointed tips, the first to appear, are particularly remarkable as they all show, on most of their length, a common parabolic profile which stays constant during the growth. Assuming that the latter occurs by lateral accretion of individual molecules in staggered configuration, we propose to give account of this prominent morphological feature along a purely geometrical argument, the profile of a tip being linked to the shape of the trajectories followed all along the accretion process. Among several possible trajectories, Fermat spirals lead to a parabolic profile in perfect agreement with the one observed for $\alpha$α-pointed tips. This is to be put in relation with the presence of such spirals in phyllotactic patterns which ensure the best packing efficiency in cases of axis-symmetry, which is indeed that of dense collagen fibrils. Moreover, those patterns are structured by concentric circles of dislocations, constitutive of the structure itself, whose behaviour might contribute to the mechanical properties of the fibrils.Graphical abstract",0.00509746,0.003742411,0.14705299,0.003042191,0.054899905,0.009397508,0.009948801,0.03179993,0.46562806,0.004254714,0.005861825,0.03319347,0.008297081,0.003440498,0.017272344,0.007262352,0.005865079,0.004386425,0.004365131,0.007198819,0.016389,0.004147187,0.006663223,0.15696,0.00514406,0.008248407,0.004149638,0.006591913,0.015590373,"['rodent', 'humans', 'hippocampus', 'human']","[0.025, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05]","[0.5, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]"

Yet, even under these extreme sub-zero conditions, macroscopic ice crystals are typically not observed on their feathers. In this work, we hypothesize that the origin of the anti-icing properties of a cold-weather penguin’s feathers comes from a unique combination of the feather’s macroscopic structure, the nanoscale topography of its barbules, and the hydrophobicity of its preen oil. We show that, the combination of all three, make cold-weather penguin feathers both highly water repellant and icephobic. In this paper, we present the results from a series of droplet freezing experiments performed on feathers from a number of species of both cold-weather and warm-weather penguins. Compared to a smooth glass substrate, freezing was delayed by a factor of 30-times for drops deposited on warm-weather penguin feathers and 60-times for cold-weather penguins. The difference in freezing time between warm- and cold-weather penguins was statistically significant and can be attributed to the increase in the contact angle measured between the drop and the feather of the cold-weather penguin. This increased contact angle is the result of an increase in the hydrophobicity of the preen oil and the inclusion of nanoscale, air-trapping dimples on the surface of the barbules. The physics of this delay are explained through the development of a simple heat transfer model which demonstrates that increasing contact angle is a primary cause of increased freezing time and icephobicity. The results of this study can be used to motivate the designs of biomimetic surfaces to minimize ice formation in extreme conditions for a number of important engineering applications.",0.006431381,0.013333012,0.005886335,0.00372451,0.00715392,0.016938725,0.006563643,0.004806668,0.013813015,0.008386268,0.005667274,0.00738712,0.004640762,0.004429905,0.003398706,0.010893883,0.006111785,0.007435718,0.00454532,0.011780257,0.008838833,0.006152864,0.8776123,0.002886806,0.006735955,0.00583092,0.006354938,0.012386678,0.008745715,['zebra finch'],[0.054054054054054],[1.0]

The hyperaccumulation phenomenon is rare (exhibited by less than 0.2% of all angiosperms), with most of the ~500 hyperaccumulator species known globally for nickel.ScopeThis review highlights the contemporary understanding of nickel hyperaccumulation processes, which include root uptake and sequestration, xylem loading and transport, leaf compartmentation and phloem translocation processes.ConclusionsHyperaccumulator plants have evolved highly efficient physiological mechanisms for taking up nickel in their roots followed by rapid translocation and sequestration into the aerial shoots. The uptake of nickel is mainly involved with low affinity transport systems, presumably from the ZIP family. The presence of high concentrations of histidine prevents nickel sequestration in roots.

Despite the extreme variation in size, their structures are strikingly similar. However, the mechanism responsible for this remarkable morphological convergence remains unknown. Using basic physical arguments and biomimetic experiments, we reveal an optimal design strategy that links their length, base diameter d 0 , Young’s modulus E and friction force per unit area μ p 0 . This principle can be framed simply as $${d}_{0} \approx {(\mu {p}_{0}/E)}^{1/3}L$$ d 0 ≈ ( μ p 0 / E ) 1 / 3 L .

Many natural surfaces are capable of rapidly shedding water droplets—a phenomenon that has been attributed to the presence of low solid fraction textures (Φs ~ 0.01). However, recent observations revealed the presence of unusually high solid fraction nanoscale textures (Φs ~ 0.25 to 0.64) on water-repellent insect surfaces, which cannot be explained by existing wetting theories. Here, we show that the contact time of bouncing droplets on high solid fraction surfaces can be reduced by reducing the texture size to ~100 nm.

To determine if aerial undulation is a flight control strategy or a non-functional behavioural vestige of lateral undulation, we measured snake glides using high-speed motion capture and developed a new dynamical model of gliding. Reconstructions of the snake’s wing-body reveal that aerial undulation is composed of horizontal and vertical waves, whose phases differ by 90° and whose frequencies differ by a factor of two. Using these results, we developed a three-dimensional mathematical model of snake flight that incorporates aerodynamic and inertial effects. Although simulated glides without undulation attained some horizontal distance, they are biologically unrealistic because they failed due to roll and pitch instabilities. In contrast, the inclusion of undulation stabilized the rotational motion and markedly increased glide performance. This work demonstrates that aerial undulation in snakes serves a different function than known uses of undulation in other animals, and suggests a new template of control for dynamic flying robots.

Once infectious particles have breached the body's physical barriers of the skin or gut lining, an initially local response quickly escalates into a systemic response, attracting mobile immune cells to the site of infection. These cells complement the initial, unspecific defense with a more specialized, targeted response. This can also provide long-term immune memory and protection against future infection. The cell-autonomous defenses of the infected cells are thus aided by the actions of recruited immune cells. These specialized cells are the most mobile cells in the body, constantly patrolling through the otherwise static tissue to detect incoming pathogens. Such constant immune surveillance means infections are noticed immediately and can be rapidly cleared from the body. Some immune cells also remove infected cells that have succumbed to infection. All this prevents pathogen replication and spread to healthy tissues. Although this may involve the sacrifice of some somatic tissue, this is typically replaced quickly. Particular care is, however, given to the reproductive organs, which should always remain disease free (immune privilege).",0.007658736,0.006242413,0.004263995,0.00475566,0.010042314,0.005331298,0.00690186,0.004350054,0.006345473,0.007877724,0.012603806,0.007845679,0.007934885,0.005321834,0.004851546,0.010427339,0.00543658,0.00516035,0.006788894,0.005961068,0.008004513,0.011206602,0.007757409,0.007119282,0.006801167,0.8836498,0.005360089,0.010582215,0.005209321,[],[],[]

This study demonstrates how ladybird beetles address these two conflicting requirements by an unprecedented technique using artificial wings. Our results, which clarify the detailed wing-folding process and reveal the supporting structures, provide indispensable initial knowledge for revealing this naturally evolved optimization system. Investigating the characteristics in the venations and crease patterns revealed in this study could provide an innovative designing method, enabling the integration of structural stability and deformability, and thus could have a considerable impact on engineering science. Ladybird beetles are high-mobility insects and explore broad areas by switching between walking and flying. Their excellent wing transformation systems enabling this lifestyle are expected to provide large potential for engineering applications. However, the mechanism behind the folding of their hindwings remains unclear. The reason is that ladybird beetles close the elytra ahead of wing folding, preventing the observation of detailed processes occurring under the elytra. In the present study, artificial transparent elytra were transplanted on living ladybird beetles, thereby enabling us to observe the detailed wing-folding processes. The result revealed that in addition to the abdominal movements mentioned in previous studies, the edge and ventral surface of the elytra, as well as characteristic shaped veins, play important roles in wing folding. The structures of the wing frames enabling this folding process and detailed 3D shape of the hindwing were investigated using microcomputed tomography. The results showed that the tape spring-like elastic frame plays an important role in the wing transformation mechanism. Compared with other beetles, hindwings in ladybird beetles are characterized by two seemingly incompatible properties: (i) the wing rigidity with relatively thick veins and (ii) the compactness in stored shapes with complex crease patterns. The detailed wing-folding process revealed in this study is expected to facilitate understanding of the naturally optimized system in this excellent deployable structure.",0.005573299,0.005302772,0.014784782,0.003432896,0.037977263,0.018633867,0.01730329,0.00436289,0.098630585,0.00333016,0.004225799,0.005531583,0.011351339,0.006581231,0.004955638,0.009905221,0.40198106,0.010682439,0.010927372,0.011441545,0.030600205,0.007238957,0.030766377,0.005032421,0.005218932,0.011322761,0.006105268,0.007914683,0.010601663,"['largemouth bass', 'channel catfish', 'teleost fish', 'teleost fishes', 'fish', 'ictalurus punctatus', 'fishes', 'barbel', 'barbels', 'catfish']","[0.0, 0.012012012012012001, 0.0030030030030030004, 0.0030030030030030004, 0.030030030030030002, 0.0, 0.024024024024024003, 0.0030030030030030004, 0.0030030030030030004, 0.012012012012012001]","[0.0, 0.4, 0.1, 0.1, 1.0, 0.0, 0.8, 0.1, 0.1, 0.4]"

Ant pollination is a rare mutualistic association and reports of ants as effective pollinators are limited to a few studies. Conospermum (Proteaceae) is an insect-pollinated genus well represented in the south-western Australia biodiversity hotspot, and here we aimed to evaluate the role of ants as pollinators of C. undulatum. Methods Pollen germination after contact with several species of ants and bees was tested for C. undulatum and five co-flowering species for comparison. We then sampled the pollen load of floral visitors of C. undulatum to assess whether ants carried a pollen load sufficient to enable pollination. Lastly, we performed exclusion treatments to assess the relative effect of flying- and non-flying-invertebrate floral visitors on the reproduction of C. undulatum. For this, we measured the seed set under different conditions: ants exclusion, flying-insects exclusion and control. Key Results Pollen of C. undulatum, along with the other Conospermum species, had a germination rate after contact with ants of ~80 % which did not differ from the effect of bees; in contrast, the other plant species tested showed a drop in the germination rate to ~10 % following ant treatments. Although ants were generalist visitors, they carried a pollen load with 68–86 % of suitable grains. Moreover, ants significantly contributed to the seed set of C. undulatum. Conclusions Our study highlights the complexity of ant–flower interactions and suggests that generalizations neglecting the importance of ants as pollinators cannot be made. Conospermum undulatum has evolved pollen with resistance to the negative effect of ant secretions on pollen grains, with ants providing effective pollination services to this threatened species.",0.050037216,0.015079375,0.005438454,0.029821916,0.007731982,0.00524679,0.009293139,0.0233897,0.03132574,0.032881606,0.009930215,0.7908491,0.009066067,0.13900013,0.012658029,0.024216302,0.011288889,0.02673365,0.279245,0.012235914,0.011345758,0.03824014,0.01136226,0.016494472,0.010264513,0.014351748,0.008024635,0.022194466,0.011080956,['mammals'],[0.021739130434782],[1.0]

An example of such an extreme morphotype is the uniquely modified vertebral column of the hero shrew Scutisorex, which features numerous accessory intervertebral articulations and massively expanded transverse processes. The function of these vertebral structures is unknown, and it is difficult to meaningfully compare them to vertebrae from animals with known behavioural patterns and spinal adaptations. Here, we use trabecular bone architecture of vertebral centra and quantitative external vertebral morphology to elucidate the forces that may act on the spine of Scutisorex and that of another large shrew with unmodified vertebrae (Crocidura goliath). X-ray micro-computed tomography (µCT) scans of thoracolumbar columns show that Scutisorex thori is structurally intermediate between C. goliath and S. somereni internally and externally, and both Scutisorex species exhibit trabecular bone characteristics indicative of higher in vivo axial compressive loads than C. goliath. Under compressive load, Scutisorex vertebral morphology is adapted to largely restrict bending to the sagittal plane (flexion).

SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into host cells via an interaction between its Spike protein and the host cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Disruption of this interaction confers potent neutralization of viral entry, providing an avenue for vaccine design and for therapeutic antibodies. Here, we develop single-domain antibodies (nanobodies) that potently disrupt the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and ACE2. By screening a yeast surface-displayed library of synthetic nanobody sequences, we identified a panel of nanobodies that bind to multiple epitopes on Spike and block ACE2 interaction via two distinct mechanisms. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) revealed that one exceptionally stable nanobody, Nb6, binds Spike in a fully inactive conformation with its receptor binding domains (RBDs) locked into their inaccessible down-state, incapable of binding ACE2. Affinity maturation and structure-guided design of multivalency yielded a trivalent nanobody, mNb6-tri, with femtomolar affinity for SARS-CoV-2 Spike and picomolar neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 infection. mNb6-tri retains stability and function after aerosolization, lyophilization, and heat treatment. These properties may enable aerosol-mediated delivery of this potent neutralizer directly to the airway epithelia, promising to yield a widely deployable, patient-friendly prophylactic and/or early infection therapeutic agent to stem the worst pandemic in a century.",0.012043047,0.005489371,0.004464674,0.008334789,0.006831771,0.003667041,0.004924216,0.007865257,0.006314185,0.00873258,0.03222942,0.022803692,0.01047006,0.007713358,0.009891477,0.009668413,0.005290523,0.005013504,0.01632241,0.004832427,0.00447303,0.016815096,0.005878039,0.011953555,0.004387204,0.68229175,0.003474509,0.008017734,0.002674104,['cephalopods'],[0.016666666666666],[1.0]

Time-lapse videography is used to record bean trajectories across a series of terrain types, including one-dimensional channels and planar surfaces of varying inclination. We find that the shell encumbers the larva's locomotion, decreasing its speed on flat surfaces by threefold. We also observe that the two-dimensional search algorithm of the bean resembles the run-and-tumble search of bacteria.

These costs and benefits can rarely be quantified simultaneously due to the complexity of the interactions within the group, or even compared to each other because of the absence of common metrics between them. The construction of 'living bridges' by New World army ants - which they use to shorten their foraging trails - is a unique example of a collective behavior where costs and benefits have been experimentally measured and related to each other. As a result, it is possible to make quantitative predictions about when and how the behavior will be observed. In this paper, we extend a previous mathematical model of these costs and benefits to much broader domain of applicability. Specifically, we exhibit a procedure for analyzing the optimal formation, and final configuration, of army ant living bridges given a means to express the geometrical configuration of foraging path obstructions. Using this procedure, we provide experimentally testable predictions of the final bridge position, as well as the optimal formation process for certain cases, for a wide range of scenarios, which more closely resemble common terrain obstacles that ants encounter in nature.

It also effectively minimizes the inertia force from high-frequency wingbeat motion. However, related studies that attempt to clarify the essence of wing flexibility remain insufficient. Here, a parametric study of a flexible wing was conducted as part of the effort to build an aerodynamic model and analyze its aerodynamic performance. The Quasi-steady (QS) modelling was adopted with experimentally determined translational forces. These forces were determined from 84 flexible wing cases while varying the angle of attack at the wing root and the flexibility parameter, slack angle , with 19 additional rigid wing cases. This study found for optimum lift generation to exceed 45° irrespective of . The coefficient curves were well-fitted with a cubed-sine function. The model was rigorously validated with various wing kinematics, giving a good estimation of the experimental results. The estimated error was less than 5%, 6%, and 8% for the lift, drag, and moment, respectively, considering fast to moderate wing kinematics. The study was extended to analyze the pure aerodynamic performance of the flexible wing. The most suitable wing for a flapping-wing micro-aerial vehicle (FWMAV) wing design with a simple vein structure was found to be the 5° slack-angled wing. The inference from this study further shows that a small amount of deformation is needed to increase the lift, as observed in natural flyers. Thus, wing deformation could allow living flyers to undertake less pitching motion in order to reduce the mechanical power and increase the efficiency of their wings.",0.010813026,0.012889446,0.012673908,0.011557573,0.019153662,0.0201449,0.015393422,0.007688335,0.01041192,0.009153897,0.005143257,0.008636181,0.015788496,0.025051152,0.008995383,0.005416617,0.8570714,0.01287987,0.012349534,0.02154457,0.024352279,0.014353475,0.022960396,0.010242659,0.014935843,0.01013664,0.011913568,0.009648682,0.018512947,"['porites porites', 'orbicella faveolata', 'acropora palmata', 'diploria labyrinthiformis', 'porites astreoides']","[0.014084507042253001, 0.014084507042253001, 0.0, 0.014084507042253001, 0.014084507042253001]","[1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0]"

These passive preflex responses aid animals to move swiftly through complex terrain. Whether preflexes play a substantial role in animal flight is uncertain. We investigated how birds cope with gusty environments and found that their wings can act as a suspension system, reducing the effects of vertical gusts by elevating rapidly about the shoulder. This preflex mechanism rejected the gust impulse through inertial effects, diminishing the predicted impulse to the torso and head by 32% over the first 80 ms, before aerodynamic mechanisms took effect. For each wing, the centre of aerodynamic loading aligns with the centre of percussion, consistent with enhancing passive inertial gust rejection. The reduced motion of the torso in demanding conditions simplifies crucial tasks, such as landing, prey capture and visual tracking.

Using empirical and computational fluid dynamics analyses, we show that remora attachment was specific to regions of separating flow and wakes caused by surface features on the whale. Adhesion at these locations offers remoras drag reduction of up to 71–84% compared with the freestream. Remoras were observed to move freely along the surface of the whale using skimming and sliding behaviors. Skimming provided drag reduction as high as 50–72% at some locations for some remora sizes, but little to none was available in regions where few to no remoras were observed. Experimental work suggests that the Venturi effect may help remoras stay near the whale while skimming.

Such assessment is usually assumed to be categorical or linear; for example, males fight more aggressively when females are present than absent, or as female fecundity increases. Here, to our knowledge for the first time, we show quadratic resource value assessment, in which resource value is highest at a certain level and decreases in either direction. The mantis shrimp Neogonodactylus bredini occupies coral rubble burrows in a size-assortative manner: individuals of a certain body size inhabit burrows of a certain size. Using mock burrows of various sizes, we tested whether mantis shrimp (1) chose burrows predicted to be the best fit for their body size and (2) were more aggressive during, endured higher costs during and were more likely to win contests over burrows predicted to be best fit. Individuals chose burrows larger than their predicted best fit burrows. In contests, intruders without burrows were more likely to evict burrow residents when the burrow was slightly smaller than the intruder's predicted best fit size. Intruder success decreased as relative burrow size increased or decreased from this value. Intruders won by delivering more strikes and by being aggressive first. In contrast to intruders, burrow residents showed little evidence of resource value assessment. A literature review revealed that quadratic resource value assessment may play a role in contests over resources from territories to parasite hosts. Therefore, our results impact theoretical models of contest behaviour and may lend insight to how contests affect resource distributions.",0.006544738,0.003566033,0.054664478,0.007655729,0.005815169,0.008931507,0.003908604,0.012826605,0.00934517,0.015130678,0.010218469,0.003374408,0.008564539,0.005539821,0.07845944,0.006144056,0.003768283,0.006378745,0.0047409,0.010871555,0.005027307,0.0083322,0.00894527,0.31115186,0.005204752,0.004623677,0.003017902,0.005063673,0.011243204,"['bacteria', 'geobacter sulfurreducens']","[0.024691358024691003, 0.012345679012345002]","[1.0, 0.5]"

Animals use sensory input not only for communication, but also for the detection, discrimination and localization of animate and inanimate objects. In addition sensory systems provide basic cues for spatial orientation and navigation. Both the structure and the physiology of sensory systems reflect the natural environment in which an animal lives and the needs of the animal. Accordingly, the relevant and often complex stimuli and noise conditions, which natural sensors evolved to cope with, have to be found and applied, to fully understand any sensory system. This is a particular challenge in cases where animals show sensory capabilities alien to human perceptions. This presentation focuses on two sensory systems that humans and most animals do not have: the infrared sensory system of pyrophilous beetles and the electrosensory system of weakly electric fish.

Using laboratory experiments on a model system, we demonstrate that an energy landscape approach helps understand how multipathway transitions across locomotor modes in complex 3D terrain statistically emerge from physical interaction. Animals’ and robots’ locomotor modes are attracted to basins of a potential energy landscape. They can use kinetic energy fluctuation from oscillatory self-propulsion to cross potential energy barriers, escaping from one basin and reaching another to make locomotor transitions. Our first-principle energy landscape approach is the beginning of a statistical physics theory of locomotor transitions in complex terrain. It will help understand and predict how animals, and how robots should, move through the real world. Effective locomotion in nature happens by transitioning across multiple modes (e.g., walk, run, climb). Despite this, far more mechanistic understanding of terrestrial locomotion has been on how to generate and stabilize around near–steady-state movement in a single mode. We still know little about how locomotor transitions emerge from physical interaction with complex terrain. Consequently, robots largely rely on geometric maps to avoid obstacles, not traverse them. Recent studies revealed that locomotor transitions in complex three-dimensional (3D) terrain occur probabilistically via multiple pathways. Here, we show that an energy landscape approach elucidates the underlying physical principles. We discovered that locomotor transitions of animals and robots self-propelled through complex 3D terrain correspond to barrier-crossing transitions on a potential energy landscape. Locomotor modes are attracted to landscape basins separated by potential energy barriers. Kinetic energy fluctuation from oscillatory self-propulsion helps the system stochastically escape from one basin and reach another to make transitions. Escape is more likely toward lower barrier direction. These principles are surprisingly similar to those of near-equilibrium, microscopic systems. Analogous to free-energy landscapes for multipathway protein folding transitions, our energy landscape approach from first principles is the beginning of a statistical physics theory of multipathway locomotor transitions in complex terrain.

While effective, entrained air voids weaken concrete and increase its permeability, thereby increasing susceptibility to multiple other forms of in situ degradation. Inspired by nature, we report that a soluble biomimetic antifreeze polymer that displays ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) and dynamic ice shaping (DIS) activities can prevent damage from ice crystal growth in cement paste and concrete. We first report that polyethylene glycol-graft-polyvinyl alcohol (PEG-PVA) mimics the explicit IRI and DIS activity of native ice-binding proteins in high-pH media characteristic of concrete pore solution. Second, we report that addition of PEG-PVA to cement paste and concrete prevents freeze-thaw damage without entraining air.

They provide protection while retaining flexibility and maneuverability of the fish. The exterior surface of the scale consists of an ultrathin discontinuous mineral layer on top of mineralized woven collagen fibrils. The underlying foundation is composed of two collagenous components. The major one consists of a single-twisted “Bouligand” structure with a twisting angle of 36°. A secondary “sheet-like” structure, formed by thinner collagen fibrils oriented along the thickness direction, acts to increase the integrity of the scale. Here, we identify the deformation and failure mechanisms of the carp scale, revealing slight tensile anisotropy. Using in situ small-angle X-ray scattering during tensile testing, the toughening mechanisms of the scale, including the adaptive structural reorientation of lamellae as well as fibrillar sliding and elastic deformation, are quantified and compared with those of other fish scales.",0.003392492,0.007206181,0.007135005,0.003589971,0.54825574,0.021997917,0.010232658,0.00628086,0.02409963,0.005977448,0.006247724,0.004204891,0.010210886,0.003649937,0.019167196,0.003603709,0.00413869,0.005509324,0.004694516,0.004735508,0.03548674,0.008407096,0.006437822,0.008319212,0.048415247,0.007726478,0.43765938,0.008508362,0.011007268,"['fish', 'electric eels', 'electric eel', 'mammals', 'fishes']","[0.051282051282051, 0.0, 0.0, 0.025641025641025002, 0.051282051282051]","[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0]"

Somewhere in the middle are the ogre-faced, net-casting spiders [1] (Deinopidae: Deinopis) that actively capture prey while being suspended within a frame web [2-5]. Using a net held between their front four legs, these spiders lunge downward to ensnare prey from off the ground beneath them. This ""forward strike"" is sensorially mediated by a massive pair of hypersensitive, night-vision eyes [5-7]. Deinopids can also intercept flying insects with a ""backward strike,"" a ballistically rapid, overhead back-twist, that seems not to rely on visual cues [4, 5, 8]. Past reports have hypothesized a role of acoustic detection in backward strike behavior [4, 5, 8]. Here, we report that the net-casting spider, Deinopis spinosa, can detect auditory stimuli from at least 2 m from the sound source, at or above 60 dB SPL, and that this acoustic sensitivity is sufficient to trigger backward strike behavior. We present neurophysiological recordings in response to acoustic stimulation, both from sound-sensitive areas in the brain and isolated forelegs, which demonstrate a broad range of auditory sensitivity (100-10,000 Hz). Moreover, we conducted behavioral assays of acoustic stimulation that confirm acoustic triggering of backward net-casting by frequencies in harmony with flight tones of known prey. However, acoustic stimulation using higher frequency sounds did not elicit predatory responses in D. spinosa. We hypothesize higher frequencies are emitted by avian predators and that detecting these auditory cues may aid in anti-predator behavior.

In diverse fish species, acoustic stimuli activate Mauthner neurons, which initiate a C-start escape response. This reflexive behavior is highly conserved across aquatic species and provides a model for investigating the neural mechanism underlying the evolution of escape behavior. Here, we characterize evolved differences in the C-start response between populations of the Mexican cavefish, Astyanax mexicanus. Cave populations of A. mexicanus inhabit an environment devoid of light and macroscopic predators, resulting in evolved differences in various morphological and behavioral traits. We find that the C-start is present in river-dwelling surface fish and multiple populations of cavefish, but that response kinematics and probability differ between populations. The Pachón population of cavefish exhibits an increased response probability, a slower response latency and speed, and reduction of the maximum bend angle, revealing evolved differences between surface and cave populations. Analysis of the responses of two other independently evolved populations of cavefish, revealed the repeated evolution of reduced angular speed. Investigation of surface-cave hybrids reveals a correlation between angular speed and peak angle, suggesting these two kinematic characteristics are related at the genetic or functional levels. Together, these findings provide support for the use of A. mexicanus as a model to investigate the evolution of escape behavior.",0.00900516,0.010153466,0.013201225,0.011900687,0.007363769,0.008054415,0.007393371,0.004284864,0.009358737,0.015702985,0.005629104,0.005968456,0.005684238,0.006983846,0.00646708,0.005097932,0.06871998,0.00870856,0.008365745,0.007920923,0.005443357,0.47431242,0.015147927,0.007637023,0.003854375,0.009571575,0.004517823,0.003964904,0.009231067,"['honey badger', 'snakes']","[0.016393442622950002, 0.032786885245901]","[0.5, 1.0]"

These outstanding mechanical properties have been mostly attributed to the interplay between aragonite platelets and organic matrices in the typical brick-and-mortar structure. Here, we show that crystallographically co-oriented stacks of aragonite platelets, in both columnar and sheet nacre, define another hierarchical level that contributes to the toughening of nacre. By correlating piezo-Raman and micro-indentation results, we quantify the residual strain energy associated with strain hardening capacity. Our findings suggest that the aragonite stacks, with characteristic dimensions of around 20 µm, effectively store energy through cooperative plastic deformation. The existence of a larger length scale beyond the brick-and-mortar structure offers an opportunity for a more efficient implementation of biomimetic design. The hierarchical structure of nacre is known to contribute to its high strength and toughness, providing inspiration for many biomimetic materials.

We investigated if repeated breakdowns in the potential capacity of CCA to spur reef development were associated with sea level, ocean temperature, CO2 concentration, CCA species diversity, and/or the evolution of major herbivore groups. Model results show that the correlation between the occurrence of CCA and the development of true coral reefs increased with CCA diversity and cooler ocean temperatures while the diversification of herbivores had a transient negative effect.

The organization of temporal information is critical for the encoding and retrieval of episodic memories. In the rodent hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, evidence accumulated over the last decade suggests that populations of “time cells” in the hippocampus encode temporal information. We identify time cells in humans using intracranial microelectrode recordings obtained from 27 human epilepsy patients who performed an episodic memory task.

A particular focus is given to optical sensing for medical diagnosis, food control and environmental monitoring, which has experienced a significant growth, especially considering the advances in obtaining inexpensive miniaturized systems, more reliability, fast responses, and the use of label-free layouts. Additionally, naturally derived biomaterials and synthetic polymers are versatile and fit many different structural designs that are underlined. Progress in bioinspired photonic polymers and their integration in novel devices is discussed since recent developments have emerged to lift the expectations of smart, flexible, wearable and portable sensors. The discussion is expanded to give emphasis on additional functionalities offered to related biomedical applications and the use of structural colours in new sustainable strategies that could meet the needs of technological development.",0.022995217,0.015680766,0.007660171,0.01139258,0.013957437,0.007396055,0.005758737,0.013665374,0.010917188,0.025411703,0.008790175,0.01173263,0.016111739,0.01388186,0.012538271,0.007229758,0.008638116,0.8648892,0.012049397,0.015465825,0.013160301,0.015158865,0.009494409,0.017899659,0.012234105,0.014870208,0.009719935,0.023949252,0.010565862,"['carabidae', 'insects', 'limnoporus', 'chrysomelidae', 'elasmostethus interstinctus', 'silphidae', 'beetles', 'spiders', 'arthropods', 'hemerobius simulans', 'limnoporus dissortis', 'diptera']","[0.017241379310344, 0.086206896551724, 0.017241379310344, 0.017241379310344, 0.017241379310344, 0.017241379310344, 0.017241379310344, 0.051724137931034, 0.034482758620689, 0.017241379310344, 0.017241379310344, 0.017241379310344]","[0.199999999999999, 1.0, 0.199999999999999, 0.199999999999999, 0.199999999999999, 0.199999999999999, 0.199999999999999, 0.6000000000000001, 0.399999999999999, 0.199999999999999, 0.199999999999999, 0.199999999999999]"

IEQ is associated with human health and productivity but maintaining good IEQ requires continuous air-conditioning resulting in a high energy consumption, especially space cooling. Bio-inspired cooling technologies focus on the fundamental mechanisms of heat transfer used by animals or plants which are considered as the keys to create a harmony between buildings and the nature, whereby IEQ can be enhanced while achieving energy efficiency. This review provides a comprehensive summary on the current bio-inspired cooling technologies, including the concepts in the research stage and the well-developed products applied in buildings, and discusses some promising designs that have the most potential for future applications. This paper is structured according to building elements, in which technologies regarding HVAC system, building materials, opaque building envelope and transparent building envelope are reviewed. The heat transfer mechanisms behind each technology including conduction, convection, evaporation or phase change and radiation are discussed. Yet successful green buildings involve a smart thermal management system for which a section is dedicated to discussing various approaches in design optimization.

Vibrational signalling is characterized using standard and high‐speed videography synchronized with laser‐doppler vibrometry, and behavioural experiments test the hypothesis that signalling functions to advertise occupancy of birch (Betula) leaves. Drumming involves raising the head and striking the leaf with the sharp edges of the open mandibles. Anal scraping involves dragging a pair of specialized oar‐shaped setae against the leaf surface. Staged encounters between leaf residents and conspecific intruders result in the resident signalling, with rates increasing as the intruder moves closer. Intruders signal significantly less often than residents. Conflicts are typically resolved within a few minutes, with the resident winning in 61% of the trials, and the intruder winning in 6%. Contests that last more than 30 min are deemed ‘ties’ and comprise the remaining 33% of trials. The results support the hypothesis that vibrational signals function to advertise leaf occupancy. Vibrational communication is believed to be widespread in Drepanoidea caterpillars, but has only been described in two species to date: D. bilineata (present study) and Drepana arcuata. It is proposed that differences in territorial behaviour and signalling between these species are related to their relative investments in silk leaf mats and shelters. The proximate and ultimate bases for the evolution of vibrational communication in caterpillars are discussed.",0.003710765,0.002521409,0.005732692,0.00429367,0.002616716,0.010884499,0.002017599,0.001843306,0.039336115,0.031820785,0.002250059,0.003196247,0.003559013,0.00319894,0.005343525,0.002965153,0.005011406,0.007172425,0.002902505,0.009364862,0.003918654,0.008380054,0.007580946,0.010448513,0.001960255,0.0024605,0.00316305,0.009290963,0.010816408,"['dionaea muscipula', 'plants']","[0.016393442622950002, 0.032786885245901]","[0.5, 1.0]"

These nanostructures are mainly dedicated to manage incoming light and recently inspired many imaging and display applications. A bioluminescent organ, such as a firefly lantern, helps to out-couple light from the body in a highly efficient fashion for delivering strong optical signals in sexual communication. However, the cuticular nanostructures, except the light-producing reactions, have not been well investigated for physical principles and engineering biomimetics. Here we report a unique observation of high-transmission nanostructures on a firefly lantern and its biological inspiration for highly efficient LED illumination. Both numerical and experimental results clearly reveal high transmission through the nanostructures inspired from the lantern cuticle. The nanostructures on an LED lens surface were fabricated by using a large-area nanotemplating and reconfigurable nanomolding with heat-induced shear thinning. The biologically inspired LED lens, distinct from a smooth surface lens, substantially increases light transmission over visible ranges, comparable to conventional antireflection coating.

Whereas ultraviolet reflection by some bird eggshells has been recently described, its physical origin remains poorly understood. In this study, we identified a porous structure in eggshells. Using Mie scattering modelling, we found it was most likely responsible for reflectance peaks (intensities of ca. 20-50%) observed in the near-UV range. These peaks were observed by spectrophotometric measurements from eggshells of several breeds of hen, one breed of duck and one breed of quail. This optical response was interpreted in terms of the distinct visual perception of hens and humans: eggshells appearing achromatic for humans proved to be chromatic for hens. Fluorescence emission from these eggs was also characterised and attributed to the presence of protoporphyrin IX and biliverdin IXα in the shells. Electron microscopy observations revealed the presence of pores within the so-called calcified shell part (i.e., at depths between ca. 20 μm and ca. 240 μm from the eggshell's outer surface). Mercury intrusion porosimetry allowed us to quantify the pore size distribution. Simulations of the UV response of this porous structure using Mie scattering theory as well as an effective approach accounting for multiple scattering indicate that these pores are responsible for the backscattering peaks observed in the UV range, in the case of beige hen eggshells. Due to the similarities between the pore size distributions observed for beige hen eggshells and other investigated poultry eggshells, we expect Mie backscattering to be the origin of the UV response of the eggshells of many other bird species.",0.008938791,0.29979616,0.005131496,0.006575902,0.006094595,0.008796953,0.005645176,0.00759596,0.010493616,0.005182223,0.004372943,0.005580703,0.006576272,0.007623717,0.006899603,0.005792954,0.005354652,0.14752035,0.00896688,0.008813971,0.009015835,0.00859589,0.04481212,0.005717316,0.006201589,0.00627494,0.006670302,0.010061037,0.005855382,"['short-faced kangaroo', 'kangaroo', 'bamboo', 'simosthenurus occidentalis', 'phascolarctos cinereus', 'ailuropoda melanoleuca', 'koala', 'giant panda']","[0.0, 0.012195121951219001, 0.012195121951219001, 0.012195121951219001, 0.0, 0.0, 0.012195121951219001, 0.0]","[0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]"

How fish use their skulls to accomplish these behaviors, however, remains unclear. Most previous mechanical models have represented the fish skull using one or more planar four-bar linkages, which have just a single degree of freedom (DoF). In contrast, truncated-cone hydrodynamic models have assumed up to five DoFs. In this study, we introduce and validate a 3D mechanical linkage model of a fish skull that incorporates the pectoral girdle and mandibular and hyoid arches. We validate this model using an in vivo motion dataset of suction feeding in channel catfish and then use this model to quantify the DoFs in the fish skull, to categorize the motion patterns of the cranial linkage during feeding, and to evaluate the association between these patterns and food motion. We find that the channel catfish skull functions as a 17-link, five-loop parallel mechanism. Despite having 19 potential DoFs, we find that seven DoFs are sufficient to describe most of the motion of the cranial linkage, consistent with the fish skull functioning as a multi-DoF, manipulation system. Channel catfish use this linkage to generate three different motion patterns (rostrocaudal wave, caudorostral wave, and compressive wave), each with its own associated food velocity profile. These results suggest that biomechanical manipulation systems must have a minimum number of DoFs to effectively control objects, whether in water or air.",0.018192627,0.009960569,0.026288323,0.006006627,0.019961469,0.031702958,0.004285542,0.008138385,0.024937853,0.05142955,0.002856599,0.003206049,0.009116639,0.00892261,0.059411526,0.003233208,0.02448118,0.005879544,0.00494951,0.005161231,0.006664523,0.008330892,0.002025399,0.012721469,0.003339774,0.005265096,0.018056815,0.003838322,0.25641114,['dragonflies'],[0.079365079365079],[1.0]

In this study, we elucidate the aerodynamic benefits of eyelashes. Through anatomical measurements, we find that 22 species of mammals possess eyelashes of a length one-third the eye width. Wind tunnel experiments confirm that this optimal eyelash length reduces both deposition of airborne particles and evaporation of the tear film by a factor of two. Using scaling theory, we find this optimum arises because of the incoming flow's interactions with both the eye and eyelashes. Short eyelashes create a stagnation zone above the ocular surface that thickens the boundary layer, causing shear stress to decrease with increasing eyelash length. Long eyelashes channel flow towards the ocular surface, causing shear stress to increase with increasing eyelash length. These competing effects result in a minimum shear stress for intermediate eyelash lengths.

How effective is a mammal's tail at repelling insects? In this combined experimental and theoretical study, we filmed horses, zebras, elephants, giraffes and dogs swinging their tails. The tail swings at triple the frequency of a gravity-driven pendulum, and requires 27 times more power input. Tails can also be used like a whip to directly strike at insects. This whip-like effect requires substantial torques from the base of the tail on the order of 101–102 N m, comparable to the torque of a sedan, but still within the physical limits of the mammal.

The simulator generates mild breezes of 1 m s–1, comparable to a mosquito's flight speed, and sufficient to deter up to 50% of mosquitoes from landing.

In Asia, honey bees have evolved under tremendous predatory pressure from social wasps in the genus Vespa, the most formidable of which are the giant hornets that attack colonies in groups, kill adult defenders, and prey on brood. We document for the first time an extraordinary collective defense used by Apis cerana against the giant hornet Vespa soror. In response to attack by V. soror, A. cerana workers foraged for and applied spots of animal feces around their nest entrances. Fecal spotting increased after colonies were exposed either to naturally occurring attacks or to chemicals that scout hornets use to target colonies for mass attack. Spotting continued for days after attacks ceased and occurred in response to V. soror, which frequently landed at and chewed on entrances to breach nests, but not Vespa velutina, a smaller hornet that rarely landed at entrances. Moderate to heavy fecal spotting suppressed attempts by V. soror to penetrate nests by lowering the incidence of multiple-hornet attacks and substantially reducing the likelihood of them approaching and chewing on entrances. We argue that A. cerana forages for animal feces because it has properties that repel this deadly predator from nest entrances, providing the first report of tool use by honey bees and the first evidence that they forage for solids that are not derived from plants. Our study describes a remarkable weapon in the already sophisticated portfolio of defenses that honey bees have evolved in response to the predatory threats they face. It also highlights the strong selective pressure honey bees will encounter if giant hornets, recently detected in western North America, become established.",0.011916493,0.007084074,0.006266784,0.03945196,0.00792608,0.002980954,0.005202675,0.004532496,0.002538061,0.010072356,0.005580992,0.005999733,0.009697246,0.3053495,0.006723267,0.00572395,0.010956414,0.005755606,0.009699811,0.003034973,0.00280554,0.044284493,0.005613381,0.013881006,0.011156026,0.020994755,0.007392853,0.006251663,0.005978502,"['bird', 'eurasian reed warbler', 'birds']","[0.07042253521126701, 0.0, 0.07042253521126701]","[1.0, 0.0, 1.0]"

Within this context, unique cephalopod proteins called reflectins have exhibited promise for biophotonics and bioelectronics applications, but the exploration of reflectins as materials has been hindered by an incomplete understanding of their structures and properties. Here, we resolve the molecular-level structure of a model reflectin variant, establish a straightforward approach to controlling the assembly of this protein, and describe a correlation between its structural characteristics and light-manipulating properties. Taken together, our findings advance current understanding of reflectin-based materials, provide insight into the color-changing capabilities of cephalopods, and afford new opportunities in biochemistry, cellular biology, bioengineering, and optics. Naturally occurring and recombinant protein-based materials are frequently employed for the study of fundamental biological processes and are often leveraged for applications in areas as diverse as electronics, optics, bioengineering, medicine, and even fashion. Within this context, unique structural proteins known as reflectins have recently attracted substantial attention due to their key roles in the fascinating color-changing capabilities of cephalopods and their technological potential as biophotonic and bioelectronic materials. However, progress toward understanding reflectins has been hindered by their atypical aromatic and charged residue-enriched sequences, extreme sensitivities to subtle changes in environmental conditions, and well-known propensities for aggregation. Herein, we elucidate the structure of a reflectin variant at the molecular level, demonstrate a straightforward mechanical agitation-based methodology for controlling this variant’s hierarchical assembly, and establish a direct correlation between the protein’s structural characteristics and intrinsic optical properties. Altogether, our findings address multiple challenges associated with the development of reflectins as materials, furnish molecular-level insight into the mechanistic underpinnings of cephalopod skin cells’ color-changing functionalities, and may inform new research directions across biochemistry, cellular biology, bioengineering, and optics.",0.005950835,0.08624201,0.00761794,0.005941543,0.013354494,0.007353062,0.004928045,0.040189125,0.009419221,0.020905942,0.003640054,0.007515128,0.006588317,0.005586851,0.032272067,0.003932788,0.006389396,0.3133436,0.008948863,0.010772493,0.011723146,0.010506278,0.010706331,0.012317459,0.00516003,0.007151018,0.008295073,0.011145674,0.009169168,"['drosophila suzukii', 'drosophila', 'insects', 'drosophilidae', 'diptera']","[0.012658227848101, 0.025316455696202, 0.012658227848101, 0.012658227848101, 0.012658227848101]","[0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]"

We explore two forms of mechanical work that may be relevant in imposing these physiological demands. Limb work, due to the forces and velocities between the stance foot and the centre of mass, could theoretically be zero given vertical limb forces and horizontal centre of mass path. To prevent pitching, skewed vertical force profiles would then be required, with forelimb forces high in late stance and hindlimb forces high in early stance. By contrast, joint work—the positive mechanical work performed by the limb joints—would be reduced with forces directed through the hip or shoulder joints. Measured quadruped kinetics show features consistent with compromised reduction of both forms of work, suggesting some degree of, but not perfect, inter-joint energy transfer. The elbows-back, knees-forward design reduces the joint work demand of a low limb-work, skewed, vertical force profile. This geometry allows periods of high force to be supported when the distal segment is near vertical, imposing low moments about the elbow or knee, while the shoulder or hip avoids high joint power despite high moments because the proximal segment barely rotates—translation over this period is due to rotation of the distal segment.",0.013844854,0.012664454,0.020380376,0.005665318,0.010119687,0.009697049,0.010010385,0.010180055,0.011875056,0.013148195,0.004013843,0.009803002,0.010565044,0.009232773,0.006653027,0.01318303,0.022616133,0.005701097,0.005101938,0.013848786,0.01865508,0.008361407,0.014134808,0.0101969,0.010146701,0.010410259,0.014123217,0.011611357,0.91720015,"['insects', 'polistes canadensis', 'polistes']","[0.010989010989010001, 0.010989010989010001, 0.010989010989010001]","[1.0, 1.0, 1.0]"

Remarkably, these materials exhibit regularity and structural coherence across multiple length scales, far beyond the size of a single cell. Here, synchrotron-based nanotomographic imaging in combination with machine-learning-based segmentation is used to reveal the structural synchronization process of nacre forming in the shell of the mollusc Unio pictorum . We show that the emergence of this highly regular layered structure is driven by a disorder-to-order transition achieved through the motion and interaction of screw-like structural dislocations with an opposite topological sign. Using an analogy to similar processes observed in liquid-crystalline systems, we demonstrate that these microstructural faults act as dissipative topological defects coupled by an elastic distortion field surrounding their cores. Their mutual annihilation results in structural synchronization that is simulated using the classical Kuramoto model. The developed experimental, theoretical and numerical framework provides a comprehensive physical view of the formation of biogenic materials. Molluscs assemble layers of material in the shells around them with a high level of control.

The holobiont can impact the nutrient balance of their hosts amid an otherwise oligotrophic environment, including by cycling physiologically important nitrogen compounds. Here we use 15 N-tracer experiments to produce the first simultaneous measurements of ammonium oxidation, nitrate reduction, and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) production among five iconic species of reef-building corals ( Acropora palmata , Diploria labyrinthiformis , Orbicella faveolata , Porites astreoides , and Porites porites ) in the highly protected Jardines de la Reina reefs of Cuba. Nitrate reduction is present in most species, but ammonium oxidation is low potentially due to photoinhibition and assimilatory competition. Coral-associated rates of N 2 O production indicate a widespread potential for denitrification, especially among D. labyrinthiformis , at rates of ~1 nmol cm −2  d −1 . In contrast, A. palmata displays minimal active nitrogen metabolism. Enhanced rates of nitrate reduction and N 2 O production are observed coincident with dark net respiration periods. Genomes of bacterial cultures isolated from multiple coral species confirm that microorganisms with the ability to respire nitrate anaerobically to either dinitrogen gas or ammonium exist within the holobiont.

In addition, G. sulfurreducens upregulated respiratory chains that could have contributed to the reductive mineralization of the metal on the cell surface. Transcriptomic evidence also revealed pathways for cell envelope modification that increased metal resistance and promoted cell-cell aggregation and biofilm formation in stationary phase.

Science, this issue p. 86 The human protein XCL1 evolved to switch between two completely different folds with different functions. Metamorphic proteins switch between different folds, defying the protein folding paradigm. It is unclear how fold switching arises during evolution. With ancestral reconstruction and nuclear magnetic resonance, we studied the evolution of the metamorphic human protein XCL1, which has two distinct folds with different functions, making it an unusual member of the chemokine family, whose members generally adopt one conserved fold. XCL1 evolved from an ancestor with the chemokine fold. Evolution of a dimer interface, changes in structural constraints and molecular strain, and alteration of intramolecular protein contacts drove the evolution of metamorphosis.

This ground effect is often modelled as an interaction between a mirrored pair of vortices represented by a true vortex and an opposite sign ‘virtual vortex’ on the other side of the wall. However, most animals do not swim near solid surfaces and thus near body vortex–vortex interactions in open-water swimmers have been poorly investigated. In this study, we examine the most energetically efficient metazoan swimmer known to date, the jellyfish Aurelia aurita, to elucidate the role that vortex interactions can play in animals that swim away from solid boundaries. We used high-speed video tracking, laser-based digital particle image velocimetry (dPIV) and an algorithm for extracting pressure fields from flow velocity vectors to quantify swimming performance and the effect of near body vortex–vortex interactions. Here, we show that a vortex ring (stopping vortex), created underneath the animal during the previous swim cycle, is critical for increasing propulsive performance. This well-positioned stopping vortex acts in the same way as a virtual vortex during wall-effect performance enhancement, by helping converge fluid at the underside of the propulsive surface and generating significantly higher pressures which result in greater thrust. These findings advocate that jellyfish can generate a wall-effect boost in open water by creating what amounts to a ‘virtual wall’ between two real, opposite sign vortex rings. This explains the significant propulsive advantage jellyfish possess over other metazoans and represents important implications for bio-engineered propulsion systems.",0.024647506,0.009020659,0.00660379,0.006247526,0.008737827,0.28568178,0.006255071,0.006064557,0.008449114,0.023180379,0.009023516,0.008747418,0.010843312,0.006488184,0.005335512,0.00872665,0.024978306,0.012177614,0.007867951,0.7757677,0.007304842,0.013275017,0.013068466,0.01637397,0.009320508,0.012850288,0.008081413,0.011945605,0.024080858,"['sea stars', 'ramp']","[0.024390243902439, 0.012195121951219001]","[1.0, 0.5]"

Nowadays, no fully effective therapy is available to erradicate or prevent this disease. Natural products could constitute a promising source of useful bioactive compounds in drug discovery. The present study is a characterization of main active compounds from the ethanolic extract of Inula viscosa (Asteraceae) leaves against N. fowleri trophozoites. Four compounds (1-4) were successfully identified by spectroscopic techniques, but only inuloxin A displayed a potential antiamoebic activity with an IC50 of 21.27 μM. The specificity of this compound toward the studied strain leads us to analyze the insight into its mechanism of action by performing in vitro assays of programmed cell death markers and to discuss the structure-activity relationship (SAR). The obtained results demonstrated that inuloxin A interferes with various processes leading to membrane damage, mitochondria alteration, chromatin condensation, and ROS accumulation, which highlight features specific to apoptosis.

These traits have generally been interpreted as key functional features that enabled the transition from piscivory to more energetic diets based on marine mammals, ultimately leading to the evolution of titanic body sizes in the most recent forms (including the emblematic Otodus megalodon ). To investigate this hypothesis, we evaluate the biomechanics of the anterior, lateral, and posterior teeth of five otodontid species under different loading conditions by using two-dimensional finite element analysis. Stress distribution patterns are remarkably similar among all models under puncture and draw (i.e., when subjected to vertical and lateral forces, respectively). Contrary to expectation, higher average stress values are detected under both loading scenarios in more recent species. Altogether, this suggests little correlation between tooth morphology and key aspects of biomechanical behaviour in otodontids, making it difficult to frame the morphological trend of their dentitions within an adaptive scenario. We propose that this pattern most likely emerged as a non-functional by-product of heterochronic processes driven by selection towards larger body sizes.",0.007204984,0.007132557,0.006804898,0.003481963,0.744904,0.008944682,0.042323124,0.006485784,0.005288731,0.010118001,0.0060384,0.002819494,0.00735474,0.003993729,0.011331851,0.004358157,0.007545149,0.005782551,0.004565429,0.005208296,0.046138745,0.005573185,0.005597243,0.005522166,0.03527822,0.007352798,0.29913276,0.007045818,0.010386619,['rat'],[0.047619047619047006],[1.0]

Li et al. analyzed the balance between plants defending themselves and plants poisoning themselves. In wild tobacco (Nicotiana attenuata), two cytochrome P450 enzymes work within the biosynthetic pathway of 17-hydroxygeranyllinalool diterpene glycosides to help prevent the accumulation of toxic diterpene derivatives. Those same diterpene derivatives are formed in an insect herbivore after ingestion and cause toxicity by inhibiting sphingolipid biosynthesis in both plant and insect. Science, this issue p. 255 In tobacco plants, diterpenoid hydroxylations inhibit sphingolipid biosynthesis, explaining their autotoxicity and role in defense from insect herbivores. Many plant specialized metabolites function in herbivore defense, and abrogating particular steps in their biosynthetic pathways frequently causes autotoxicity. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their defense and autotoxicity remain unclear. Here, we show that silencing two cytochrome P450s involved in diterpene biosynthesis in the wild tobacco Nicotiana attenuata causes severe autotoxicity symptoms that result from the inhibition of sphingolipid biosynthesis by noncontrolled hydroxylated diterpene derivatives. Moreover, the diterpenes’ defensive function is achieved by inhibiting herbivore sphingolipid biosynthesis through postingestive backbone hydroxylation products. Thus, by regulating metabolic modifications, tobacco plants avoid autotoxicity and gain herbivore defense. The postdigestive duet that occurs between plants and their insect herbivores can reflect the plant’s solutions to the “toxic waste dump” problem of using potent chemical defenses.",0.009512264,0.004775904,0.005148811,0.018101374,0.003938549,0.003739076,0.004328256,0.00947285,0.006380559,0.00370034,0.037847634,0.018396365,0.36524034,0.031093381,0.004176148,0.005157726,0.005849171,0.006355098,0.007324123,0.005111498,0.00456012,0.009222162,0.008453821,0.007519643,0.012627095,0.020812351,0.005436549,0.008260778,0.004698004,[],[],[]

In contrast, birds fly reliably over open water and at night, despite being more susceptible to gusts due to their much lower flight speeds. We found that even inexperienced lovebirds can navigate through strong opposing gusts in the dark, with only a faint point light source as a beacon. Their ability is surprising, because it was previously thought that diurnal animals needed a visual horizon and image features moving over their retina to maneuver. Instead, lovebirds fixate their head on the beacon while reorienting their body into the gust like a weathervane, enabling them to infer gust angle via neck twist and compensate accordingly. Flying birds maneuver effectively through lateral gusts, even when gust speeds are as high as flight speeds. What information birds use to sense gusts and how they compensate is largely unknown. We found that lovebirds can maneuver through 45° lateral gusts similarly well in forest-, lake-, and cave-like visual environments. Despite being diurnal and raised in captivity, the birds fly to their goal perch with only a dim point light source as a beacon, showing that they do not need optic flow or a visual horizon to maneuver. To accomplish this feat, lovebirds primarily yaw their bodies into the gust while fixating their head on the goal using neck angles of up to 30°. Our corroborated model for proportional yaw reorientation and speed control shows how lovebirds can compensate for lateral gusts informed by muscle proprioceptive cues from neck twist. The neck muscles not only stabilize the lovebirds’ visual and inertial head orientations by compensating low-frequency body maneuvers, but also attenuate faster 3D wingbeat-induced perturbations. This head stabilization enables the vestibular system to sense the direction of gravity. Apparently, the visual horizon can be replaced by a gravitational horizon to inform the observed horizontal gust compensation maneuvers in the dark. Our scaling analysis shows how this minimal sensorimotor solution scales favorably for bigger birds, offering local wind angle feedback within a wingbeat. The way lovebirds glean wind orientation may thus inform minimal control algorithms that enable aerial robots to maneuver in similar windy and dark environments.",0.02434547,0.053809404,0.021657132,0.011784105,0.00881632,0.05436647,0.007046279,0.003902819,0.008744037,0.004926492,0.003880453,0.00491424,0.007342351,0.009950178,0.003629078,0.002077023,0.25113156,0.005663154,0.00513424,0.017908469,0.005630273,0.054310005,0.00977107,0.007981529,0.003586914,0.010876207,0.004303135,0.002971917,0.007407659,[],[],[]

Prior documentation of resistance to snake venom α-neurotoxins consists of the N-glycosylation motif or the hypothesized introduction of arginine at positions 187 at the α-1 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor orthosteric site. However, no further studies have investigated the possibility of other potential forms of resistance. Using a biolayer interferometry assay, we first confirm that the previously hypothesized resistance conferred by arginine at position 187 in the honey badger does reduce binding to α-neurotoxins, which has never been functionally tested. We further discovered a novel form of α-neurotoxin resistance conferred by charge reversal mutations, whereby a negatively charged amino acid is replaced by the positively charged amino acid lysine. As venom α-neurotoxins have evolved strong positive charges on their surface to facilitate binding to the negatively charged α-1 orthosteric site, these mutations result in a positive charge/positive charge interaction electrostatically repelling the α-neurotoxins. Such a novel mechanism for resistance has gone completely undiscovered, yet this form of resistance has convergently evolved at least 10 times within snakes.

Previous studies have suggested butterflies use several unsteady aerodynamic mechanisms to boost force production with upstroke wing clap being a prominent feature. When the wings clap together at the end of upstroke the air between the wings is pressed out, creating a jet, pushing the animal in the opposite direction. Although viewed, for the last 50 years, as a crucial mechanism in insect flight, quantitative aerodynamic measurements of the clap in freely flying animals are lacking. Using quantitative flow measurements behind freely flying butterflies during take-off and a mechanical clapper, we provide aerodynamic performance estimates for the wing clap. We show that flexible butterfly wings, forming a cupped shape during the upstroke and clap, thrust the butterfly forwards, while the downstroke is used for weight support. We further show that flexible wings dramatically increase the useful impulse (+22%) and efficiency (+28%) of the clap compared to rigid wings. Combined, our results suggest butterflies evolved a highly effective clap, which provides a mechanistic hypothesis for their unique wing morphology.

Burying beetle parents have the opportunity to influence microbially derived semiochemicals, because they monopolize a small carcass for their family, repairing feeding holes and applying exudates that alter the microbial community. To study adaptive manipulation of microbial cues, we integrated mechanistic and functional approaches. We contrasted gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) volatile profiles from carcasses that were or were not prepared by a resident pair of Nicrophorus orbicollis. Methyl thiocyanate (MeSCN), the primary attractant for burying beetles seeking a fresh carcass, was reduced 20-fold by carcass preparation, while dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS), which deters breeding beetles, was increased 20-fold. These results suggest that parental care serves to make previously public information more private (crypsis, MeSCN) and to disinform rivals with a deterrent (DMTS). Functional tests in the field demonstrated that carcass preparation reduced discovery and use by congeners (threefold) as well as by dipteran rivals.

Soil nutrients such as nitrogen sources are not uniformly distributed. Neither are plant roots. Nonetheless, roots of Arabidopsis seedlings seek out pockets of soil ammonium and nitrate. Otvos et al. clarify how root growth and branching are regulated to optimize nitrogen uptake. The auxin efflux carrier PIN-FORMED 2 (PIN2) is regulated posttranscriptionally by phosphorylation at its serine-439 in response to shifts in ammonium or nitrate availability. Phosphorylation in turn triggers changes in PIN2 subcellular localization, which drives changes in auxin distribution between root cortex and epidermis, causing altered root growth rate or direction.

Many of the mechanically morphing materials systems found in nature are based on hierarchical structures, which are the basis for mechanical robustness and often also the key to responsive behavior. Many ""operating principles"" involve cascades of events that translate cues from the environment into changes of the overall structure and/or the connectivity of the constituting building blocks at various levels. These concepts permit dramatic property variations without significant compositional changes. Inspired by the function and the growing understanding of the operating principles at play in biological materials with the capability to change their mechanical properties, significant efforts have been made toward mimicking such architectures and functions in artificial materials. Research in this domain has rapidly grown in the last two decades and afforded many examples of bioinspired materials that are able to reversibly alter their stiffness, shape, porosity, density, or hardness upon remote stimulation.

The hemolymph of 75 species of insects and six spiders from interior and arctic Alaska were screened for thermal hysteresis (a difference between the freezing and melting points), characteristic of the presence of AFPs. Eighteen species of insects and three spiders were shown to have AFPs. Ten of the insects with AFPs were beetles including the first species from the families Chrysomelidae, Pythidae, Silphidae and Carabidae. In addition, the first Neuropteran to have AFPs was identified, the lacewing Hemerobius simulans together with the second and third Diptera (the first Tipulids) and the second and third Hemiptera, the stinkbug Elasmostethus interstinctus (the first Pentatomid), and the water strider Limnoporus dissortis (the first Gerrid). Prior to this study, 33 species of insects and three spiders had been reported to have AFPs. Most AFP-producing terrestrial arthropods are freeze avoiding, and the AFPs function to prevent freezing. However, some of the AFP- producing insects identified in this study are known to be freeze tolerant (able to survive freezing) to very low temperatures (-40 to -70 degrees C).",0.010301637,0.010918717,0.006427899,0.006708218,0.008561969,0.007615226,0.007782186,0.005095267,0.006069262,0.007560754,0.014430366,0.006011566,0.007565879,0.006190085,0.003980249,0.018963495,0.005336995,0.006811608,0.005657024,0.006084318,0.008628758,0.005722379,0.93015754,0.004130944,0.008296168,0.008095108,0.005744162,0.0117075,0.011700776,[],[],[]

The herbivorous turtle ants Cephalotes possess a conserved gut microbiome which enriches the nutrient composition by recycling nitrogen-rich metabolic waste to increase the production of amino acids. This enrichment is assumed to benefit the host, but we do not know to what extent. To gain insights into nitrogen assimilation in the ant cuticle we use gut bacterial manipulation, 15N isotopic enrichment, isotope-ratio mass spectrometry, and 15N nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to demonstrate that gut bacteria contribute to the formation of proteins, catecholamine cross-linkers, and chitin in the cuticle.

It is well-known that in the human brain, voltage changes in certain regions result from concerted electrical activity which, in the form of action potentials (APs), travels within nerve-cell arrays. Electro- and magnetophysiological techniques like electroencephalography, magnetoencephalography, and magnetic resonance imaging are used to record this activity and to diagnose disorders. Here we demonstrate that APs in a multicellular plant system produce measurable magnetic fields. Using atomic optically pumped magnetometers, biomagnetism associated with electrical activity in the carnivorous Venus flytrap, Dionaea muscipula, was recorded. Action potentials were induced by heat stimulation and detected both electrically and magnetically. Furthermore, the thermal properties of ion channels underlying the AP were studied.

Many species possessed skull morphologies that were relatively structurally reinforced with bone, suggesting that they were adapted to incorporate particularly resistant foods into their diets. However, the functional roles of many unique, robust features of the sthenurine cranium are not yet clearly defined. Here, the finite element method is applied to conduct a comprehensive analysis of unilateral biting along the cheek tooth battery of a well-represented sthenurine, Simosthenurus occidentalis. The results are compared with those of an extant species considered to be of most similar ecology and cranial proportions to this species, the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus). The simulations reveal that the cranium of S. occidentalis could produce and withstand comparatively high forces during unilateral biting. Its greatly expanded zygomatic arches potentially housed enlarged zygomaticomandibularis muscles, shown here to reduce the risk of dislocation of the temporomandibular joint during biting with the rear of a broad, extensive cheek tooth row. This may also be a function of the zygomaticomandibularis in the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), another species known to exhibit an enlarged zygomatic arch and hypertrophy of this muscle. Furthermore, the expanded frontal plates of the S. occidentalis cranium form broad arches of bone with the braincase and deepened maxillae that each extend from the anterior tooth rows to their opposing jaw joints. These arches are demonstrated here to be a key feature in resisting high torsional forces during unilateral premolar biting on large, resistant food items. This supports the notion that S. occidentalis fed thick, lignified vegetation directly to the cheek teeth in a similar manner to that described for the giant panda when crushing mature bamboo culms.",0.004839752,0.005441775,0.004550812,0.004472658,0.015936919,0.003530197,0.024645133,0.004146584,0.004279956,0.01399332,0.004381155,0.003799784,0.014293706,0.004926371,0.061724517,0.007513564,0.016976347,0.005964124,0.004108039,0.003524855,0.042673938,0.005207493,0.005487161,0.007937449,0.028336924,0.005143765,0.121664785,0.013005707,0.0370569,[],[],[]

Wild populations are increasingly impacted by agricultural intensification, yet it is unknown whether this alters biodiversity mediation of disease dynamics. We investigated the association between plant diversity (species richness, diversity) and infection risk (virus richness, prevalence) in populations of Plantago lanceolata in natural landscapes as well as those occurring at the edges of cultivated fields. Altogether, 27 P. lanceolata populations were surveyed for population characteristics and sampled for PCR detection of five recently characterized viruses. We find that plant species richness and diversity correlated negatively with virus infection prevalence. Virus species richness declined with increasing plant diversity and richness in natural populations while in agricultural edge populations species richness was moderately higher, and not associated with plant richness. This difference was not explained by changes in host richness between these two habitats, suggesting potential pathogen spill‐over and increased transmission of viruses across the agro‐ecological interface. Host population connectivity significantly decreased virus infection prevalence. We conclude that human use of landscapes may change the ecological laws by which natural communities are formed with far reaching implications for ecosystem functioning and disease.",0.015212377,0.006735761,0.008908841,0.007226689,0.007857301,0.003770553,0.005887746,0.006045625,0.007631774,0.009715543,0.01250891,0.022542099,0.007376687,0.014305516,0.004116344,0.007031874,0.007584825,0.006632794,0.01807156,0.005830832,0.005594207,0.020866025,0.005273999,0.009614577,0.005926491,0.7983987,0.004066988,0.007736402,0.004567512,[],[],[]

Humans and other organisms use feedback between movement and sensing known as ‘sensorimotor coordination’ or ‘active perception’ to inform behaviour, but active perception has not before been investigated at a cellular level within organs. Here we provide the first proof of concept in silico/in vivo study demonstrating that filopodia (actin-rich, dynamic, finger-like cell membrane protrusions) play an unexpected role in speeding up collective endothelial decisions during the time-constrained process of ‘tip cell’ selection during blood vessel formation (angiogenesis). We first validate simulation predictions in vivo with live imaging of zebrafish intersegmental vessel growth. Further simulation studies then indicate the effect is due to the coupled positive feedback between movement and sensing on filopodia conferring a bistable switch-like property to Notch lateral inhibition, ensuring tip selection is a rapid and robust process. We then employ measures from computational neuroscience to assess whether filopodia function as a primitive (basal) form of active perception and find evidence in support. By viewing cell behaviour through the ‘basal cognitive lens' we acquire a fresh perspective on the tip cell selection process, revealing a hidden, yet vital time-keeping role for filopodia. Finally, we discuss a myriad of new and exciting research directions stemming from our conceptual approach to interpreting cell behaviour.

This makes dragonflies a great system to explore the role of passive stabilizing mechanisms that do not compromise manoeuvrability. We challenged dragonflies by dropping them from selected inverted attitudes and collected 6-degrees-of-freedom aerial recovery kinematics via custom motion capture techniques. From these kinematic data, we performed rigid-body inverse dynamics to reconstruct the forces and torques involved in righting behaviour. We found that inverted dragonflies typically recover themselves with the shortest rotation from the initial body inclination. Additionally, they exhibited a strong tendency to pitch-up with their head leading out of the manoeuvre, despite the lower moment of inertia in the roll axis. Surprisingly, anaesthetized dragonflies could also complete aerial righting reliably. Such passive righting disappeared in recently dead dragonflies but could be partially recovered by waxing their wings to the anaesthetised posture. Our kinematics data, inverse dynamics model and wind-tunnel experiments suggest that the dragonfly's long abdomen and wing posture generate a rotational tendency and passive attitude recovery mechanism during falling.

Newborn calves maintained a high rectal temperature (Tre) (+39 to +41°C) even at —23°C by increasing heat production 5- to 6-fold through non-shivering thermogenesis, stimulated by cold-induced noradrenaline (NA). Plasma NA and thyroxine (T4) were high (18 ng/ml and 459 nmol/1) in neonatal reindeer. Sensitivity to exogenous NA was lost during the first 3-4 weeks of life. At +20°C and above, calves increased Tre (ca 1°C), oxygen consumption and heart rate, thereby showing poor heat tolerance. Thermal conductance was low in a cold environment, but rose sharply as ambient temperature (Ta) increased above + 10°C. The Tre of adults (+ 38 to +39°C) was independent of Ta (—28 to +15°C). Coarse (hollow) hair density and length in adults averaged 2000/cm2 and 12 mm on the legs, 1000/cm3 and 30 mm on the abdomen and 1700/cm2 and 30 mm on the back (calves 3200/cm2, 10 mm), respectively. The dependence of skin temperature on the Ta was linear in excised fur samples, but complex in living animals being strongest in the legs.

However, substantial challenges exist in interpreting and translating these rodent findings to other mammalian groups, including humans, making research on nonhuman primates crucial. Both monogamous and non-monogamous species exist within Eulemur, a genus of strepsirrhine primate, offering a rare opportunity to broaden a comparative perspective on oxytocin and vasopressin neurocircuitry with increased evolutionary relevance to humans. We performed oxytocin and arginine vasopressin 1a receptor autoradiography on 12 Eulemur brains from seven closely related species to (1) characterize receptor distributions across the genus, and (2) examine differences between monogamous and non-monogamous species in regions part of putative “pair-bonding circuits”. We find some binding patterns across Eulemur reminiscent of olfactory-guided rodents, but others congruent with more visually oriented anthropoids, consistent with lemurs occupying an ‘intermediary’ evolutionary niche between haplorhine primates and other mammalian groups.

It is generally assumed that, to correct for displacements outside the familiar area, birds initially gather information within their year-round distribution range, learn predictable spatial gradients of environmental cues within it, and extrapolate from those to unfamiliar magnitudes-the gradient hypothesis.6,9,18-22 However, the nature of the cues and evidence for actual extrapolation remain elusive. Geomagnetic cues (inclination, declination, and total intensity) provide predictable spatial gradients across large parts of the globe and could serve for navigation. We tested the orientation of long-distance migrants, Eurasian reed warblers, exposing them to geomagnetic cues of unfamiliar magnitude encountered beyond their natural distribution range. The birds demonstrated re-orientation toward their migratory corridor as if they were translocated to the corresponding location but only when all naturally occurring magnetic cues were presented, not when declination was changed alone.

Even in relatively unexploited niches, females interact directly and indirectly with conspecifics at oviposition sites. These interactions can take the form of host marking and re-assessment of prior oviposition sites during the decision-making process. Considerable research has focused on the niche breadth and host preference of the polyphagous invasive pest Drosophila suzukii Matsumura (Diptera: Drosophilidae), but little information exists on how conspecific signals modulate oviposition behavior. We investigated three layers of social information that female D. suzukii may use in oviposition site selection—(1) pre-existing egg density, (2) pre-existing larval occupation, and (3) host marking by adults. We found that the presence of larvae and host marking, but not egg density, influenced oviposition behavior and that the two factors interacted over time. Adult marking appeared to deter oviposition only in the presence of an unmarked substrate. These results are the first behavioral evidence for a host marking pheromone in a species of Drosophila .

However, paradoxes arise when organisms divert altruism towards more-distantly-related recipients. In some social insects, workers ‘drift’ extensively between colonies and help raise less-related foreign brood, seemingly reducing inclusive fitness. Since being highlighted by W. D. Hamilton, three hypotheses (bet-hedging, indirect reciprocity, and diminishing returns to cooperation) have been proposed for this surprising behaviour. Here we show using inclusive fitness theory that bet-hedging and indirect reciprocity could only drive cooperative drifting under improbable conditions. However, diminishing returns to cooperation create a simple context in which sharing workers is adaptive. Using a longitudinal dataset comprising over a quarter of a million nest-cell observations, we quantify cooperative payoffs in the Neotropical wasp Polistes canadensis, where drifting occurs at high levels. As the worker-to-brood ratio rises in a worker’s home colony, the predicted marginal benefit of a worker for expected colony productivity diminishes. Helping on related colonies can allow effort to be focused on related brood that are more in need of care. Finally, we use simulations to show that cooperative drifting evolves under diminishing returns when dispersal is local, allowing altruists to focus their efforts on related recipients. Our results indicate the power of nonlinear fitness effects to shape social organisation, and suggest that models of eusocial evolution should be extended to include neglected social interactions within colony networks.",0.008242395,0.004089546,0.016331317,0.025314689,0.006573893,0.003743171,0.00284038,0.005522127,0.00582068,0.012430732,0.008830962,0.012647306,0.007062574,0.012932423,0.00582772,0.004437661,0.005848793,0.008854019,0.013295871,0.003292106,0.003096033,0.28705466,0.005760115,0.025070544,0.003966732,0.013087427,0.002639412,0.002675695,0.003547749,"['bamboo', 'moso bamboo']","[0.140350877192982, 0.052631578947368]","[1.0, 0.375]"

Here we report on a novel putative floral mimicry system in which the pseudoflowers are composed entirely of fungal tissues in contrast to modified leaves documented in previous mimicry systems. Pseudoflowers on two perennial Xyris species (yellow-eyed grass, X. setigera and X. surinamensis) collected from savannas in Guyana were produced by Fusarium xyrophilum, a novel Fusarium species. These pseudoflowers mimic Xyris flowers in gross morphology and are ultraviolet reflective. Axenic cultures of F. xyrophilum produced two pigments that had fluorescence emission maxima in light ranges that trichromatic insects are sensitive to and volatiles known to attract insect pollinators. One of the volatiles emitted by F. xyrophilum cultures (i.e., 2-ethylhexanol) was also detected in the head space of X. laxifolia var. iridifolia flowers, a perennial species native to the New World. Results of microscopic and PCR analyses, combined with examination of gross morphology of the pseudoflowers, provide evidence that the fungus had established a systemic infection in both Xyris species, sterilized them and formed fungal pseudoflowers containing both mating type idiomorphs. Fusarium xyrophilum cultures also produced the auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and the cytokinin isopentenyl adenosine (iPR). Field observations revealed that pseudoflowers and Xyris flowers were both visited by bees. Together, the results suggest that F. xyrophilum pseudoflowers are a novel floral mimicry system that attracts insect pollinators, via visual and olfactory cues, into vectoring its conidia, which might facilitate outcrossing of this putatively heterothallic fungus and infection of previously uninfected plants.",0.023674676,0.012525089,0.010049732,0.08762297,0.004708252,0.003539036,0.003428202,0.007817727,0.003448396,0.019850897,0.006193342,0.011176882,0.00665459,0.41138685,0.011757947,0.004637779,0.009087459,0.010046401,0.022869058,0.00359022,0.002858764,0.029743306,0.005219017,0.010904534,0.005814177,0.017813114,0.005885536,0.009236691,0.009464925,"['rat', 'rodent', 'pig', 'loaches', 'mouse']","[0.020408163265306003, 0.010204081632653001, 0.010204081632653001, 0.010204081632653001, 0.010204081632653001]","[1.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]"

The protein domain-receptor interactions permit P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes (IE) to evade elimination in the spleen by adhering to the microvasculature in various organs including the placenta. The sequences for the main components of the fractions, determined by tandem mass spectrometry, yielded four T-superfamily conotoxins, one (CC-Loop-CC) with I-IV, II-III connectivity and three (CC-Loop-CXaaC) with a I-III, II-IV connectivity. The 3D structure for one of the latter, NuxVA = GCCPAPLTCHCVIY, revealed a novel scaffold defined by double turns forming a hairpin-like structure stabilized by the two disulfide bonds. Two other main fraction components were a miniM conotoxin, and a O2-superfamily conotoxin with cysteine framework VI/VII. This study is the first one of its kind suggesting the use of conotoxins for developing pharmacological tools for anti-adhesion adjunct therapy against malaria. Similarly, mitigation of emerging diseases like AIDS and COVID-19, can also benefit from conotoxins as inhibitors of protein-protein interactions as treatment. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Among the 850+ species of cone snail species there are hundreds of thousands of diverse venom exopeptides that have been selected throughout several million years of evolution to capture prey and deter predators. They do so by targeting several surface proteins present in target excitable cells. This immense biomolecular library of conopeptides can be explored for potential use as therapeutic leads against persistent and emerging diseases affecting non-excitable systems. We aim to expand the pharmacological reach of conotoxins/conopeptides by revealing their in vitro capacity to disrupt protein-protein and protein-polysaccharide interactions that directly contribute to pathology of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. This is significant for severe forms of malaria, which might be deadly even after treated with current parasite-killing drugs because of persistent cytoadhesion of P. falciparum infected erythrocytes even when parasites within red blood cells are dead. Anti-adhesion adjunct drugs would de-sequester or prevent additional sequestration of infected erythrocytes and may significantly improve survival of malaria patients. These results provide a lead for further investigations into conotoxins and other venom peptides as potential candidates for anti-adhesion or blockade-therapies. This study is the first of its kind and it suggests that conotoxins can be developed as pharmacological tools for anti-adhesion adjunct therapy against malaria.

Having memory about the environment is key in taking informed decisions. Physarum polycephalum excels as a giant unicellular eukaryote, being even able to solve optimization problems despite the lack of a nervous system. Here, we follow experimentally the organism’s response to a nutrient source and find that memory about nutrient location is encoded in the morphology of the network-shaped organism. Our theoretical predictions in line with our observations unveil the mechanism behind memory encoding and demonstrate the P. polycephalum’s ability to read out previously stored information. The concept of memory is traditionally associated with organisms possessing a nervous system. However, even very simple organisms store information about past experiences to thrive in a complex environment—successfully exploiting nutrient sources, avoiding danger, and warding off predators. How can simple organisms encode information about their environment? We here follow how the giant unicellular slime mold Physarum polycephalum responds to a nutrient source. We find that the network-like body plan of the organism itself serves to encode the location of a nutrient source. The organism entirely consists of interlaced tubes of varying diameters. Now, we observe that these tubes grow and shrink in diameter in response to a nutrient source, thereby imprinting the nutrient’s location in the tube diameter hierarchy. Combining theoretical model and experimental data, we reveal how memory is encoded: a nutrient source locally releases a softening agent that gets transported by the cytoplasmic flows within the tubular network. Tubes receiving a lot of softening agent grow in diameter at the expense of other tubes shrinking. Thereby, the tubes’ capacities for flow-based transport get permanently upgraded toward the nutrient location, redirecting future decisions and migration.

The model biflagellate Chlamydomonas reinhardtii rotates at a constant 1-2 Hz as it swims, but the mechanism is unclear. Here, we show unequivocally that the rolling motion derives from a persistent, nonplanar flagellar beat pattern. This is revealed by high-speed imaging and micromanipulation of live cells. We construct a fully 3D model to relate flagellar beating directly to the free-swimming trajectories. For realistic geometries, the model reproduces both the sense and magnitude of the axial rotation of live cells. We show that helical swimming requires further symmetry breaking between the two flagella. These functional differences underlie all tactic responses, particularly phototaxis.

While behavioral responses such as burrowing into sand or sheltering in rock crevices can help minimize hydrodynamic loads, previous work shows that sea stars also alter body shape in response to flow conditions. This morphological plasticity suggests that sea star body shape may play an important hydrodynamic role. In this study, we measured the fluid forces acting on surface-mounted sea star and spherical dome models in water channel tests. All sea star models created downforce, i.e., the fluid pushed the body towards the surface. In contrast, the spherical dome generated lift. We also used Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) to measure the midplane flow field around the models. Control volume analyses based on the PIV data show that downforce arises because the sea star bodies serve as ramps that divert fluid away from the surface. These observations are further rationalized using force predictions and flow visualizations from numerical simulations. The discovery of downforce generation could explain why sea stars are shaped as they are: the pentaradial geometry aids attachment to surfaces in the presence of high hydrodynamic loads.",0.010098397,0.003722322,0.025830263,0.003035432,0.012053455,0.06827827,0.00365627,0.00348719,0.19796284,0.09292878,0.005330516,0.007209007,0.005056866,0.002236725,0.025742011,0.004056603,0.007256839,0.003692444,0.008870877,0.0817627,0.003279169,0.007327872,0.0051217,0.033758838,0.003991931,0.004506885,0.005082901,0.009707908,0.007537903,"['sea otter', 'mammals']","[0.08163265306122401, 0.040816326530612006]","[1.0, 0.5]"

This system consists of Photovoltaic (PV), Wind Turbine (WT) as well as Fuel Cell (FC) with hydrogen gas tank for storing the energy in the chemical form. The optimal components sizes of the proposed hybrid generating system are achieved using a novel metaheuristic optimization technique. This optimization technique, called Improved Artificial Ecosystem Optimization (IAEO), is proposed for enhancing the performance of the conventional Artificial Ecosystem Optimization (AEO) algorithm. The IAEO improves the convergence trends of the original AEO, gives the best minimum objective function, reaches the optimal solution after a few iterations numbers as well as reduces the falling into the local optima. The proposed IAEO algorithm for solving the multiobjective optimization problem of minimizing the Cost of Energy (COE), the reliability index presented by the Loss of Power Supply Probability (LPSP), and excess energy under the constraints are considered. The hybrid system is suggested to be located in Ataka region, Suez Gulf (latitude 30.0, longitude 32.5), Egypt, and the whole lifetime of the suggested case study is 25 years. To ensure the accurateness, stability, and robustness of the proposed optimization algorithm, it is examined on six different configurations, representing on-grid and off-grid hybrid RES. For all the studied cases the proposed IAEO algorithm outperforms the original AEO and generates the minimum value of the fitness function in less execution time. Furthermore, comprehensive statistical measurements are demonstrated to prove the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Also, the results obtained by the conventional AEO and IAEO are compared with those obtained by several well-known optimization algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA), and Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO). Based on the obtained simulation results, the proposed IAEO has the best performance among other algorithms and it has successfully positioned itself as a competitor to novel algorithms for tackling the most complicated engineering problems.",0.023240432,0.007573323,0.012327052,0.007544941,0.005169589,0.001988165,0.002240436,0.007572112,0.002818505,0.003099327,0.008424115,0.009653125,0.007517509,0.005067068,0.001982405,0.003550125,0.002464641,0.003310759,0.01218,0.003618383,0.002857488,0.016640818,0.009399198,0.003117591,0.005369463,0.003315213,0.004508113,0.00331991,0.00629164,"['bamboo', 'giant panda']","[0.075, 0.0]","[1.0, 0.0]"

This discovery motivated us to create distorted neuron models by modifying the dendritic patterns, so generating neurons across wide ranges of D extending beyond their natural values. By charting the D-dependent variations in inter-neuron connectivity along with the associated costs, we propose that their D values reflect a network cooperation that optimizes these constraints. We discuss the implications for healthy and pathological neurons, and for connecting neurons to medical implants.

We find that placebo vs. control treatments induce small, widespread reductions in pain-related activity, particularly in regions belonging to ventral attention (including mid-insula) and somatomotor networks (including posterior insula). Behavioral placebo analgesia correlates with reduced pain-related activity in these networks and the thalamus, habenula, mid-cingulate, and supplementary motor area. Placebo-associated activity increases occur mainly in frontoparietal regions, with high between-study heterogeneity. We conclude that placebo treatments affect pain-related activity in multiple brain areas, which may reflect changes in nociception and/or other affective and decision-making processes surrounding pain.

Some species can exert self-control for several seconds whereas others, such as large-brained vertebrates, can tolerate delays of up to several minutes. Advanced self-control has been linked to better performance in cognitive tasks and has been hypothesized to evolve in response to specific socio-ecological pressures. These pressures are difficult to uncouple because previously studied species face similar socio-ecological challenges. Here, we investigate self-control and learning performance in cuttlefish, an invertebrate that is thought to have evolved under partially different pressures to previously studied vertebrates. To test self-control, cuttlefish were presented with a delay maintenance task, which measures an individual's ability to forgo immediate gratification and sustain a delay for a better but delayed reward. Cuttlefish maintained delay durations for up to 50–130 s. To test learning performance, we used a reversal-learning task, whereby cuttlefish were required to learn to associate the reward with one of two stimuli and then subsequently learn to associate the reward with the alternative stimulus. Cuttlefish that delayed gratification for longer had better learning performance.

Is it, for example, a method by which a potential victim encourages a predator to direct its attention elsewhere? We investigate this possibility by using the marginal value theorem to analyse predator behaviour in the context of this defence strategy by potential prey. We consider two models. In the first, (random revisiting) the predator may return to sites it has already depleted within the patch. In the second, (systematic search) the predator goes only to new sites within the patch. The results of the two models are qualitatively extremely similar. We show that when prey occur in patches, PCI favours prey survival. Indeed, certain antlion larvae have PCI durations characterized by very long half-lives.

The acoustic signals of other animals represent particularly potent sources of noise for chorusing insects, frogs, and birds, which contend with a multi-species analog of the human ""cocktail party problem"" (i.e., our difficulty following speech in crowds). However, current knowledge of the diverse adaptations that function to solve noise problems in nonhuman animals remains limited. Here, we show that a lung-to-ear sound transmission pathway in frogs serves a heretofore unknown noise-control function in vertebrate hearing and sound communication. Inflated lungs improve the signal-to-noise ratio for communication by enhancing the spectral contrast in received vocalizations in ways analogous to signal processing algorithms used in hearing aids and cochlear implants. Laser vibrometry revealed that the resonance of inflated lungs selectively reduces the tympanum's sensitivity to frequencies between the two spectral peaks present in conspecific mating calls. Social network analysis of continent-scale citizen science data on frog calling behavior revealed that the calls of other frog species in multi-species choruses can be a prominent source of environmental noise attenuated by the lungs. Physiological modeling of peripheral frequency tuning indicated that inflated lungs could reduce both auditory masking and suppression of neural responses to mating calls by environmental noise. Together, these data suggest an ancient adaptation for detecting sound via the lungs has been evolutionarily co-opted to create auditory contrast enhancement that contributes to solving a multi-species cocktail party problem.",0.015931131,0.025884029,0.006915015,0.030638717,0.00707403,0.005659705,0.005081697,0.005400001,0.014448504,0.007649356,0.006326811,0.008684611,0.013020624,0.011232803,0.006627169,0.003344183,0.027854519,0.060821146,0.010335159,0.007535025,0.007027806,0.36408246,0.003793584,0.017517082,0.003823951,0.010643545,0.004500387,0.005338478,0.003520037,"['arthropods', 'spiders']","[0.013698630136986, 0.068493150684931]","[0.2, 1.0]"

European vipers (genus Vipera) have a characteristic dorsal zigzag pattern, which has been shown to serve as a warning signal to potential predators. At the same time, it has been suggested to decrease detection risk, and to cause a motion dazzle or flicker–fusion effect during movement. We tested these hypotheses by asking whether (1) the zigzag pattern decreases detection risk and (2) the detection is dependent on the base coloration (grey or brown) or the snake's posture (coiled, basking form or S-shaped, active form). Additionally, (3) we measured the fleeing speed of adders, Vipera berus, and calculated the flicker rate of the zigzag pattern, to see whether it is fast enough to cause a flicker–fusion effect against predators. Our results show that the zigzag pattern reduced detectability regardless of base coloration or posture of the snake. The brown zigzag morph was detected less often than the grey zigzag morph. The fleeing speed of adders appeared to be fast enough to induce a flicker–fusion effect for mammalian predators. However, it is unlikely to be fast enough to induce the flicker–fusion effect for raptors. Our findings highlight that the colour pattern of animals can be multifunctional.

The reflectins act as a signal transducer, precisely tuning the dimensions and refractive index of the membrane-bounded structural reflectors containing them to an extent exactly proportional to neuronal signaling. This calibration between the activating signal and the output color and intensity of reflectance is governed by the physics of the liquid state of reflectin assemblies, which osmotically fine-tune the dimensions and refractive index of the membrane-bounded structural reflectors containing them. While thin-film or genetically engineered assemblies of reflectin deliver changes in the colors of reflection approximating those of the biological system (as do other proteins and polymers), none has delivered the signal-activated increase in the intensity of reflectance characteristic of the native system.

By focusing on the binary symbiosis between Vibrio fischeri and Euprymna scolopes, we have combined genetic analysis with direct imaging to define and study small molecules in the intact symbiosis. ABSTRACT The lifelong relationship between the Hawaiian bobtail squid Euprymna scolopes and its microbial symbiont Vibrio fischeri represents a simplified model system for studying microbiome establishment and maintenance. The bacteria colonize a dedicated symbiotic light organ in the squid, from which bacterial luminescence camouflages the host in a process termed counterillumination. The squid host hatches without its symbionts, which must be acquired from the ocean amidst a diversity of nonbeneficial bacteria, such that precise molecular communication is required for initiation of the specific relationship. Therefore it is likely there are specialized metabolites used in the light organ microenvironment to modulate these processes. To identify small molecules that may influence the establishment of this symbiosis, we used imaging mass spectrometry to analyze metabolite production in V. fischeri with altered biofilm production, which correlates directly to colonization capability in its host. “Biofilm-up” and “biofilm-down” mutants were compared to a wild-type strain, and ions that were more abundantly produced by the biofilm-up mutant were detected. Using a combination of structural elucidation and synthetic chemistry, one such signal was determined to be a diketopiperazine, cyclo(d-histidyl-l-proline). This diketopiperazine modulated luminescence in V. fischeri and, using imaging mass spectrometry, was directly detected in the light organ of the colonized host. This work highlights the continued need for untargeted discovery efforts in host-microbe interactions and showcases the benefits of the squid-Vibrio system for identification and characterization of small molecules that modulate microbiome behaviors. IMPORTANCE The complexity of animal microbiomes presents challenges to defining signaling molecules within the microbial consortium and between the microbes and the host. By focusing on the binary symbiosis between Vibrio fischeri and Euprymna scolopes, we have combined genetic analysis with direct imaging to define and study small molecules in the intact symbiosis. We have detected and characterized a diketopiperazine produced by strong biofilm-forming V. fischeri strains that was detectable in the host symbiotic organ, and which influences bacterial luminescence. Biofilm formation and luminescence are critical for initiation and maintenance of the association, respectively, suggesting that the compound may link early and later development stages, providing further evidence that multiple small molecules are important in establishing these beneficial relationships.",0.009542714,0.008721215,0.004956814,0.010055857,0.008534327,0.003384198,0.002809168,0.01398853,0.009781239,0.010987849,0.006062158,0.007667264,0.008870655,0.019630289,0.013011179,0.004770203,0.006215732,0.4311492,0.011166748,0.006783445,0.004963062,0.013471945,0.0025343,0.016841574,0.005073433,0.016273461,0.005309505,0.010152273,0.004896657,"['asteraceae', 'hypochaeris radicata']","[0.028985507246376004, 0.014492753623188002]","[1.0, 0.5]"

Similar to classical Batesian and Müllerian mimicry related to distastefulness, such ‘evasive aposematism' may also lead to convergence in warning colours, known as evasive mimicry. A prime candidate group for evasive mimicry are Adelpha butterflies, which are agile insects and show remarkable colour pattern convergence. We tested the ability of naive blue tits to learn to avoid and generalize Adelpha wing patterns associated with the difficulty of capture and compared their response to that of birds that learned to associate the same wing patterns with distastefulness. Birds learned to avoid all wing patterns tested and generalized their aversion to other prey to some extent, but learning was faster with evasive prey compared to distasteful prey. Our results on generalization agree with longstanding observations of striking convergence in wing colour patterns among Adelpha species, since, in our experiments, perfect mimics of evasive and distasteful models were always protected during generalization and suffered the lowest attack rate. Moreover, generalization on evasive prey was broader compared to that on distasteful prey. Our results suggest that being hard to catch may deter predators at least as effectively as distastefulness.

The biomechanics underlying the predatory strike of dragonfly larvae is not yet understood. Dragonfly larvae are aquatic ambush predators, capturing their prey with a strongly modified extensible mouthpart. The current theory of hydraulic pressure being the driving force of the predatory strike can be refuted by our manipulation experiments and reinterpretation of former studies. Here, we report evidence for an independently loaded synchronized dual-catapult system. To power the ballistic movement of a single specialized mouthpart, two independently loaded springs simultaneously release and actuate two separate joints in a kinematic chain. Energy for the movement is stored by straining an elastic structure at each joint and, possibly, the surrounding cuticle, which is preloaded by muscle contraction. As a proof of concept, we developed a bioinspired robotic model resembling the morphology and functional principle of the extensible mouthpart.

Males of the false black widow spider, Steatoda grossa, in European populations also produce stridulatory courtship sound which has not yet been studied in their invaded North American range. Working with a North American population of S. grossa, we tested the hypotheses that (1) web reduction by males renders webs less attractive to rival males; (2) deposition of silk by courting males has an inter-sexual (male-female) signal function that enhances their likelihood of copulation; and (3) stridulatory sound is a courtship signal of males. Testing anemotactic attraction of males in Y-tube olfactometer experiments revealed that reduced webs (indicative of a mated female) and intact webs (indicative of a virgin female) were equally attractive to males. Recording courtship behavior of males with either functional (silk-releasing) spinnerets or spinnerets experimentally occluded on the web of virgin females showed that males with functional spinnerets were more likely to copulate with the female they courted. Although males possess the stridulatory apparatus to produce courtship sound, they did not stridulate when courting or copulating on the web of females. Our data support the conclusion that web-reduction behavior of S. grossa males in their invaded North American range has no long-range effect on mate seeking males. Instead, web-reduction behavior has an inter-sexual signaling function that seems to be linked to functional spinnerets of the courting male. The signal produced by a male likely entails a volatile silk-borne pheromone, but may also embody a gauge of his endurance (the amount of time he engages in web reduction causing web vibrations).",0.011142869,0.005697938,0.016661782,0.025431504,0.008952094,0.011744236,0.003876987,0.006995894,0.018806724,0.87989956,0.006908711,0.023718389,0.004932356,0.025656022,0.016947724,0.007909806,0.008886335,0.011951651,0.016261496,0.011591749,0.003019285,0.037680887,0.005527275,0.026565917,0.009927917,0.010632774,0.008281406,0.01236254,0.014323971,[],[],[]

Here, we tested the control function of gecko toes by running them on vertical substrates varying in orientation, friction and roughness. Sideways wall-running geckos realigned the toes of their top feet upward to resist gravity. Toe contact area was not compromised, but redistributed. Geckos aligned all toes upward to resist slipping when encountering low-friction patches during sideways wall-running. Negotiation of intermittent slippery strips showed an increased contribution of particular toes to compensate for toes that lost adhesion. Increasing substrate roughness using discrete rods perpendicular to sideways locomotion resulted in geckos bending and/or rotating toes to conform to and even grasp the rods, with potential forces more than five times body weight. Geckos increase their effectiveness of manoeuvrability in demanding environments by taking advantage of the distributed control afforded by multiple toes.

We consider stability within the sagittal plane and model the dynamics of running as a two-dimensional body with alternating aerial and stance phases. Stance is modelled as a passive, impulsive collision followed by an active, impulsive push-off that compensates for collisional losses. Such a runner has infinitely many strategies to maintain periodic gaits on flat ground. However, these strategies differ in how perturbations due to terrain unevenness are propagated. Instabilities manifest as tumbling (orientational instability) or failing to maintain a steady speed (translational instability). We find that open-loop strategies that avoid sensory feedback are sufficient to maintain stability on step-like terrains with piecewise flat surfaces that randomly vary in height. However, these open-loop runners lose orientational stability on rough terrains whose slope also varies randomly. The orientational instability is significantly mitigated by minimizing the tangential collision, which typically requires sensory information and anticipatory strategies such as leg retraction. By analysing the propagation of perturbations, we derive a single dimensionless parameter that governs stability.

We found that interactions between generalists tended to persist more in time and space such that interactions near the network core were more frequently recorded across years, within seasons, and among plots.

Our efficient synthesis is highly convergent, builds upon cheap and abundant starting materials, features a thermal [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement and a novel FeCl3-promoted cascade reaction to rapidly construct the critical cycloheptadienone core of the curcusones, and led us to complete the first total synthesis of curcusones A and B in only 9 steps, C and D in 10 steps, and dimericursone A in 12 steps. The chemical synthesis of dimericursone A from curcusones C and D provided direct evidence to support the proposed Diels-Alder dimerization and cheletropic elimination biosynthetic pathway. Using an alkyne-tagged probe molecule, BRAT1, an important but previously ""undruggable"" oncoprotein, was identified as a key cellular target via chemoproteomics. We further demonstrate for the first time that BRAT1 can be inhibited by curcusone D, resulting in impaired DNA damage response, reduced cancer cell migration, potentiated activity of the DNA damaging drug etoposide, and other phenotypes similar to BRAT1 knockdown.",0.005360793,0.00349034,0.003935172,0.006620468,0.005076284,0.002792955,0.002663916,0.009157418,0.004039633,0.003668545,0.006932809,0.031681117,0.012856302,0.009324973,0.002727427,0.003588252,0.003514144,0.003313156,0.004009528,0.00228445,0.003891346,0.008882837,0.00361018,0.006240951,0.005167851,0.08007345,0.002217654,0.003473101,0.004352425,[],[],[]

The tensile strength of discrete volumes of limpet tooth material measured using in situ atomic force microscopy was found to range from 3.0 to 6.5 GPa and was independent of sample size. These observations highlight an absolute material tensile strength that is the highest recorded for a biological material, outperforming the high strength of spider silk currently considered to be the strongest natural material, and approaching values comparable to those of the strongest man-made fibres. This considerable tensile strength of limpet teeth is attributed to a high mineral volume fraction of reinforcing goethite nanofibres with diameters below a defect-controlled critical size, suggesting that natural design in limpet teeth is optimized towards theoretical strength limits.",0.007873465,0.007871414,0.013469265,0.005745047,0.92376107,0.011171798,0.036964677,0.019952333,0.009371832,0.014116282,0.010673251,0.005015874,0.008232305,0.009192825,0.010983492,0.011700314,0.016142465,0.011332053,0.010079495,0.007430212,0.027409831,0.006486103,0.01221427,0.012569848,0.6024462,0.013975345,0.1331356,0.013983494,0.009882137,[],[],[]

When flying in this manner, the birds can travel long distances without flapping, centimeters above the ocean’s surface. Here we derive a theoretical framework for assessing the energetic savings related to this behavior, ‘wave-slope soaring,’ in which an organism in flight takes advantage of localized updrafts caused by traveling ocean surface gravity waves. Methods The energy cost of steady, constant altitude flight in and out of ground effect are analyzed as controls. Potential flow theory is used to quantify the ocean wave-induced wind associated with near-shoaling, weakly nonlinear, shallow water ocean surface gravity waves moving through an atmosphere initially at rest. Using perturbation theory and the Green’s function for Laplace’s equation in 2D with Dirichlet boundary conditions, we obtain integrals for the horizontal and vertical components of the wave-induced wind in a frame of reference moving with the wave. Wave-slope soaring flight is then analyzed using an energetics-based approach for waves under a range of ocean conditions and the body plan of P. occidentalis. Results For ground effect flight, we calculate a ∼15 - 25% reduction in cost of transport as compared with steady, level flight out of ground effect. When wave-slope soaring is employed at flight heights ∼2m in typical ocean conditions (2m wave height, 15s period), we calculate 60-70% reduction in cost of transport as compared with flight in ground effect. A relatively small increase in swell amplitude or decrease in flight height allows up to 100% of the cost of transport to be offset by wave-slope soaring behavior. Conclusions The theoretical development presented here suggests there are energy savings associated with wave-slope soaring. Individual brown pelicans may significantly decrease their cost of transport utilizing this mode of flight under typical ocean conditions. Thus wave-slope soaring may provide fitness benefit to these highly mobile organisms that depend on patchy prey distribution over large home ranges.",0.033159968,0.026140926,0.025675002,0.005741522,0.004819479,0.07484558,0.004380232,0.003911241,0.006601482,0.005210277,0.002432913,0.004177758,0.005219021,0.007996731,0.002150322,0.002021013,0.06408183,0.004730093,0.004959312,0.041752785,0.005007447,0.009878153,0.033010956,0.004984362,0.003142058,0.004823382,0.002621981,0.002702948,0.00881093,[],[],[]

To overcome this challenge, diving arthropods have evolved to respire without resurfacing using air held between their cuticle and surrounding water.1-4 Inspired by natural history observations in Haiti (unpublished data) and Costa Rica,5,6 we conducted experiments documenting routine air-based underwater respiration in several distantly related semi-aquatic Anolis lizard species. Semi-aquatic anoles live along neotropical streams and frequently dive for refuge or food,7-12 remaining underwater for up to 18 min. While submerged, these lizards iteratively expire and re-inspire narial air bubbles-underwater ""rebreathing."" Rebreathed air is used in respiration, as the partial pressure of oxygen in the bubbles decreases with experimental submersion time in living anoles, but not in mechanical controls. Non-aquatic anoles occasionally rebreathe when submerged but exhibit more rudimentary rebreathing behaviors. Anole rebreathing is facilitated by a thin air layer (i.e., a ""plastron,"" sensu Brocher13) supported by the animal's rugose skin upon submergence. We suggest that hydrophobic skin, which we observed in all sampled anoles,14,15 may have been exaptative, facilitating the repeated evolution of specialized rebreathing in species that regularly dive. Phylogenetic analyses strongly suggest that specialized rebreathing is adaptive for semi-aquatic habitat specialists. Air-based rebreathing may enhance dive performance by incorporating dead space air from the buccal cavity or plastron into the lungs, facilitating clearance of carbon dioxide, or allowing uptake of oxygen from surrounding water (i.e., a ""physical gill"" mechanism4,16).",0.011594722,0.003648163,0.018583253,0.001772144,0.071929276,0.106865466,0.022934312,0.005340056,0.18140984,0.004124736,0.006268896,0.003291147,0.005687749,0.002398269,0.006453488,0.019450823,0.027119663,0.007077856,0.004389133,0.017240684,0.023033325,0.00398314,0.11899734,0.004188715,0.00302775,0.006079162,0.004342883,0.003668673,0.023275798,[],[],[]

How brains use sensory cues from participants to synchronize performances is not known. We examined the interactions between sensory cues and motor activity in the brains of female and male plain-tailed wrens that rapidly take turns to produce a duet that sounds as if a single bird is singing. We made simultaneous neurophysiological recordings from the brains of pairs of awake, duetting wrens. We discovered that inhibition driven by auditory feedback from the partner alternated with the premotor activity used by each individual to produce its own vocalizations. These data show how sensory feedback links the brains of cooperating animals through the modulation of motor circuits. Coordination of behavior for cooperative performances often relies on linkages mediated by sensory cues exchanged between participants. How neurophysiological responses to sensory information affect motor programs to coordinate behavior between individuals is not known. We investigated how plain-tailed wrens (Pheugopedius euophrys) use acoustic feedback to coordinate extraordinary duet performances in which females and males rapidly take turns singing. We made simultaneous neurophysiological recordings in a song control area “HVC” in pairs of singing wrens at a field site in Ecuador. HVC is a premotor area that integrates auditory feedback and is necessary for song production. We found that spiking activity of HVC neurons in each sex increased for production of its own syllables. In contrast, hearing sensory feedback produced by the bird’s partner decreased HVC activity during duet singing, potentially coordinating HVC premotor activity in each bird through inhibition. When birds sang alone, HVC neurons in females but not males were inhibited by hearing the partner bird. When birds were anesthetized with urethane, which antagonizes GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric acid) transmission, HVC neurons were excited rather than inhibited, suggesting a role for GABA in the coordination of duet singing. These data suggest that HVC integrates information across partners during duets and that rapid turn taking may be mediated, in part, by inhibition.",0.004054273,0.009822595,0.010104219,0.047565874,0.005909553,0.008390024,0.009163707,0.005996793,0.049080294,0.010406639,0.007091864,0.026672745,0.010866557,0.009852577,0.009479457,0.011202629,0.11275486,0.02067155,0.006674771,0.0100558,0.005902773,0.49280074,0.01284935,0.023255039,0.006193509,0.021488134,0.004095214,0.007235692,0.004222255,[],[],[]

To date, it is highly controversial whether such capability can be adapted in mammalian species as another site for gas exchange. Here, we report the advent of the intestinal breathing phenomenon in mammalians by exploiting EVA (enteral ventilation via anus). Methods Two different modes of EVA were investigated in an experimental model of respiratory failure: intra-rectal oxygen O2 gas ventilation (g-EVA) or liquid ventilation (l-EVA) with oxygenated perfluorocarbon. After induction of type 1 respiratory failure, we analyzed the effectiveness of g-EVA and I-EVA in mouse and pig, followed by preclinical safety analysis in rat. Findings Both intra-rectal O2 gas and oxygenated liquid delivery were shown to provide vital rescue of experimental models of respiratory failure, improving survival, behavior, and systemic O2 level. A rodent and porcine model study confirmed the tolerable and repeatable features of an enema-like l-EVA procedure with no major signs of complications. Conclusions EVA has proven effective in mammalians such that it oxygenated systemic circulation and ameliorated respiratory failure. Due to the proven safety of perfluorochemicals in clinics, EVA potentially provides an adjunctive means of oxygenation for patients under respiratory distress conditions.

We explored the role of microbes present in extracts of oral secretion (OS) isolated from larvae of Spodoptera litura, a generalist herbivore, in phytohormone signaling-dependent defense responses in Arabidopsis thaliana (arabidopsis). In response to mechanical damage (MD) with application of bacteria-free OS (OS- ) prepared by sterilization or filtration of OS, arabidopsis leaves exhibited enhanced de novo synthesis of oxylipins, and induction of transcript levels of the responsible genes, in comparison to those in leaves with MD + non-sterilized OS (OS+ ), indicating that OS bacteria serve as suppressors of these genes. By contrast, de novo synthesis/signaling of salicylic acid and signaling of abscisic acid were enhanced by OS bacteria. These signaling networks were cross-regulated by each other. Meta-analysis of OS bacteria identified 70 bacterial strains. Among them was Staphylococcus epidermidis, an anaerobic staphylococcus that was shown to contribute to the suppression/manipulation of phytohormone-dependent plant defense signaling.

However, this work disclosed an unusual swimming model of Ray sperms whose propulsion is from not only the helical tail but also the unique spiral head (i.e., the head can contribute ∼31% of the force in propulsion). Such a propulsion mechanism provides Ray sperms with high adaptability to large environmental viscosities along with advantages in linearity, straightness, and efficiency. This study expands our knowledge on the microorganisms’ motion and provides inspirations for engineering design. We disclose a peculiar rotational propulsion mechanism of Ray sperms enabled by its unusual heterogeneous dual helixes with a rigid spiral head and a soft tail, named Heterogeneous Dual Helixes (HDH) model for short. Different from the conventional beating propulsion of sperm, the propulsion of Ray sperms is from both the rotational motion of the soft helical tail and the rigid spiral head. Such heterogeneous dual helical propulsion style provides the Ray sperm with high adaptability in viscous solutions along with advantages in linearity, straightness, and bidirectional motion. This HDH model is further corroborated by a miniature swimming robot actuated via a rigid spiral head and a soft tail, which demonstrates similar superiorities over conventional ones in terms of adaptability and efficiency under the same power input.

So far, the ability to detect and respond to floral humidity cues has been only established for hawkmoths when they locate and extract nectar while hovering in front of some moth-pollinated flowers. To test whether floral humidity can be used by other more widespread generalist pollinators, we designed artificial flowers that presented biologically relevant levels of humidity similar to those shown by flowering plants. Bumblebees showed a spontaneous preference for flowers that produced higher floral humidity. Furthermore, learning experiments showed that bumblebees are able to use differences in floral humidity to distinguish between rewarding and non-rewarding flowers. Our results indicate that bumblebees are sensitive to different levels of floral humidity. In this way floral humidity can add to the information provided by flowers and could impact pollinator behaviour more significantly than previously thought.",0.004872742,0.012608566,0.002734184,0.030994514,0.002029199,0.003382138,0.003380162,0.003448622,0.004049695,0.010369327,0.003302567,0.005563883,0.003556938,0.02168891,0.002420761,0.006291944,0.005699694,0.010470726,0.004301371,0.004292416,0.002388037,0.028852465,0.045082323,0.002862844,0.005323538,0.00462695,0.003353366,0.013398836,0.00542041,[],[],[]

A notable exception to this rule is the sea otter, a species that is orders of magnitude smaller and skinnier than the others. It is known that the sea otter's unusually thick fur helps, but Wright et al. show that they are also internally warmed by thermogenic leak from skeletal muscle, a process that elevates their metabolic rate three times above that expected for their size. This mechanism is present even in infants with immature muscles, providing these animals with internal warmth from birth. Science, abf4557, this issue p. 223 Thermogenesis is a primary regulator of sea otter muscle metabolism, allowing them to inhabit cold water. Basal metabolic rate generally scales with body mass in mammals, and variation from predicted levels indicates adaptive metabolic remodeling. As a thermogenic adaptation for living in cool water, sea otters have a basal metabolic rate approximately three times that of the predicted rate; however, the tissue-level source of this hypermetabolism is unknown. Because skeletal muscle is a major determinant of whole-body metabolism, we characterized respiratory capacity and thermogenic leak in sea otter muscle. Compared with that of previously sampled mammals, thermogenic muscle leak capacity was elevated and could account for sea otter hypermetabolism. Muscle respiratory capacity was modestly elevated and reached adult levels in neonates. Premature metabolic development and high leak rate indicate that sea otter muscle metabolism is regulated by thermogenic demand and is the source of basal hypermetabolism.",0.008228339,0.013252296,0.008474959,0.005367956,0.013776175,0.030916845,0.008551815,0.007207673,0.015199709,0.008045859,0.012340261,0.005420805,0.007309435,0.005428784,0.004950593,0.015055394,0.007281698,0.008650236,0.006094217,0.014814902,0.009365977,0.00675467,0.9560046,0.003949029,0.009701291,0.008801291,0.009208953,0.009418109,0.020030094,[],[],[]

The wing components, also known as structural elements, are responsible for the various aspects of the wing functionality. Considering the complex interactions between the wing components, modelling of the wings as a whole is only possible with inevitable huge oversimplifications. In order to overcome this difficulty, we have recently proposed a new approach to model individual components of complex wings comparatively. Here, we use this approach to study nodus, a structural element of dragonfly wings which has been less studied to date. Using a combination of several imaging techniques including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), wide-field fluorescence microscopy (WFM), confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) scanning, we aim to characterize the spatial morphology and material composition of fore- and hindwing nodi of the dragonfly Brachythemis contaminata. The microscopy results show the presence of resilin in the nodi, which is expected to help the deformability of the wings. The computational results based on three-dimensional (3D) structural data suggest that the specific geometry of the nodus restrains its displacements when subjected to pressure on the ventral side. This effect, resulting from an interlocking mechanism, is expected to contribute to the dorso-ventral asymmetry of wing deformation and to provide a higher resistance to aerodynamic forces during the downstroke. Our results provide an important step towards better understanding of the structure-property-function relationship in dragonfly wings.


STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
In this study, we investigate the wing nodus, a specialized wing component in dragonflies. Using a combination of modern imaging techniques, we demonstrate the presence of resilin in the nodus, which is expected to facilitate the wing deformability in flight. The specific geometry of the nodus, however, seems to restrain its displacements when subjected to pressure on the ventral side. This effect, resulting from an interlocking mechanism, is suggested to contribute to dorso-ventral asymmetry of wing deformations and to provide a higher resistance to aerodynamic forces during the downstroke. Our results provide an important step towards better understanding of the structure-property-function relationship in dragonfly wings and might help to design more efficient wings for biomimetic micro-air vehicles.",0.010186764,0.011643502,0.017318344,0.009205177,0.035385493,0.020944314,0.020857682,0.009255469,0.01731741,0.007407444,0.005452706,0.009009225,0.016445816,0.020874137,0.009292077,0.006857199,0.8735841,0.013459529,0.014276029,0.015314917,0.027674729,0.015980193,0.024372814,0.010862278,0.01362543,0.011583235,0.010835603,0.007496348,0.015206441,[],[],[]

Using synchrotron-based scanning nanofocus X-ray diffraction methods, combining wide-angle X-ray diffraction/scattering and small-angle X-ray scattering, allowed substantial quantitative information to be gained about the structure and materials of these fibrous adhesive structures with 200 nm resolution. The fibre diffraction patterns showed the crystalline chitin chains oriented along the long axis of the attachment setae and increased intensity of the chitin signal dorsally within the seta shaft. The small-angle scattering signals clearly indicated an angular shift by approximately 80° of the microtrich structures that branch off the bulk hair shaft and end as the adhesive contact elements in the tip region of the seta.

Therefore, we might expect that annual differences in the availability of these resources must simply be tolerated, but Pashalidou et al. made observations suggesting that bees may have strategies to cope with irregular seasonal flowering (see the Perspective by Chittka). When faced with a shortage of pollen, bumble bees actively damaged plant leaves in a characteristic way, and this behavior resulted in earlier flowering by as much as 30 days. Experimenters were not able to fully replicate the results with their own damage, suggesting that there is a distinct method that the bees use to stimulate earlier flowering. Science, this issue p. 881; see also p. 824 Bumble bees manipulate plants to bring about earlier flowering. Maintaining phenological synchrony with flowers is a key ecological challenge for pollinators that may be exacerbated by ongoing environmental change. Here, we show that bumble bee workers facing pollen scarcity damage leaves of flowerless plants and thereby accelerate flower production. Laboratory studies revealed that leaf-damaging behavior is strongly influenced by pollen availability and that bee-damaged plants flower significantly earlier than undamaged or mechanically damaged controls. Subsequent outdoor experiments showed that the intensity of damage inflicted varies with local flower availability; furthermore, workers from wild colonies of two additional bumble bee species were also observed to damage plant leaves.

However, these wingless arthropods have been found 4 km up in the sky [1], dispersing hundreds of kilometers [2]. To disperse, spiders “balloon,” whereby they climb to the top of a prominence, let out silk, and float away. The prevailing view is that drag forces from light wind allow spiders to become airborne [3], yet ballooning mechanisms are not fully explained by current aerodynamic models [4, 5]. The global atmospheric electric circuit and the resulting atmospheric potential gradient (APG) [6] provide an additional force that has been proposed to explain ballooning [7]. Here, we test the hypothesis that electric fields (e-fields) commensurate with the APG can be detected by spiders and are sufficient to stimulate ballooning. We find that the presence of a vertical e-field elicits ballooning behavior and takeoff in spiders. We also investigate the mechanical response of putative sensory receivers in response to both e-field and air-flow stimuli, showing that spider mechanosensory hairs are mechanically activated by weak e-fields. Altogether, the evidence gathered reveals an electric driving force that is sufficient for ballooning. These results also suggest that the APG, as additional meteorological information, can reveal the auspicious time to engage in ballooning. We propose that atmospheric electricity adds key information to our understanding and predictive capability of the ecologically important mass migration patterns of arthropod fauna [8].

Here, we show that single-cell-level memory patterns can be imprinted in bacterial biofilms by light-induced changes in the membrane potential. We demonstrate that transient optical perturbations generate a persistent and robust potassium-channel-mediated change in the membrane potential of bacteria within the biofilm. The light-exposed cells respond in an anti-phase manner, relative to unexposed cells, to both natural and induced oscillations in extracellular ion concentrations. This anti-phase response, which persists for hours following the transient optical stimulus, enables a direct single-cell resolution visualization of spatial memory patterns within the biofilm.

In some populations of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops spp.), males cooperate in small groups or alliances to gain access to females for mating. However, the occurrence of these male cooperative groups has been predicted to occur only under certain social and ecological conditions, driven by factors such as differences in population density, operational sex ratio, and sexual size dimorphism. Here, we used generalized affiliation indices, social network techniques, and maternally and bi-parentally inherited genetic markers to investigate the affiliation patterns and genetic relatedness among male southern Australian bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops cf. australis) in a small embayment in South Australia. Photo-identification data and biopsy samples were collected in Coffin Bay from 2013 to 2015 through systematic boat-based surveys. We found that highly sighted male dolphins formed 12 social clusters composed of two to five individuals. Genetic analyses revealed that general male affiliation patterns were significantly correlated with mtDNA haplotype sharing. In addition, preferred affiliates showed significantly higher levels of genetic relatedness compared to casual and avoided male pairs. Our results corroborate theoretical expectations for the formation of social bonds in small delphinids and suggest that a high density of dolphins, with an expected skewed operational sex ratio and no apparent sexual size dimorphism, is likely to have favored the formation of strong male affiliations. In addition, the availability of genetic relatives within the population may have favored male affiliations based on kinship relationships.Significance statementMale bottlenose dolphins use different strategies to gain access to females, from single roving individuals, pairs or trios in alliances, to stable mixed-sex groups. Moreover, the role of kinship in the formation of male social bonds also varies within and among populations. This variability has been attributed to differences in ecological and intrinsic factors. Here, we studied the affiliation patterns and genetic relatedness in southern Australian bottlenose dolphins and demonstrated that kinship plays an important role in the formation of close male social ties. Furthermore, the results corroborate previous findings about the factors that contribute to the formation of male social bonds in these animals.",0.007234531,0.003821533,0.064268716,0.013469231,0.007981547,0.005586488,0.002875951,0.005118705,0.007358302,0.043377876,0.005553437,0.006909883,0.004125594,0.007266502,0.01245533,0.004954376,0.003731302,0.002749576,0.004278548,0.003706772,0.001435857,0.022904076,0.005123505,0.055184703,0.004011002,0.00274097,0.001950751,0.002109459,0.007258753,[],[],[]

These insects evolved specialized structures to adhere to different surfaces typical for their specific ecological environments. The cuticle of their tarsal attachment pads (euplantulae) is known to possess a high diversity of attachment microstructures (AMS) which are suggested to reflect ecological specializations of different groups within phasmids. However, the origin of these microstructures and their developmental background remain largely unknown. Here, based on the detailed scanning electron microscopy study of pad surfaces, we present a theoretical approach to mathematically model an outstanding diversity of phasmid AMS using the reaction–diffusion model by Alan Turing. In general, this model explains pattern formation in nature. For the first time, we were able to identify eight principal patterns and simulate the transitions among these. In addition, intermediate transitional patterns were predicted by the model. The ease of transformation suggests a high adaptability of the microstructures that might explain the rapid evolution of pad characters. We additionally discuss the functional morphology of the different microstructures and their assumed advantages in the context of the ecological background of species.",0.012759795,0.006253225,0.011906946,0.010347496,0.011917134,0.006784374,0.00481236,0.008129448,0.014669498,0.7848662,0.005975131,0.009899998,0.00793427,0.007073721,0.29809493,0.006336348,0.005089602,0.007368009,0.008311639,0.007813282,0.006344841,0.007694202,0.006531658,0.023098681,0.005199678,0.007631196,0.00620133,0.012415901,0.013754017,[],[],[]

However, the quantitative measurements of pollen adhesion on biological surfaces have been poorly studied so far. We performed atomic force microscopy adhesion measurements of pollen on two most important floral parts for Asteraceae in a course of pollination: the stigma and style of Hypochaeris radicata plant. The results indicated distinct adhesive properties of them—the pollen adhesion on stigmatic surfaces drastically increased over prolonged contact time, while the pollen adhesion increase on stylar surfaces was rather restrained. Based on the observation with cryo-scanning electron microscopy, we explained the experimental results by the presence of morphological features in form of flexible stigmatic papillae that may play a crucial role in enhancing both capillary attraction and van der Waals forces. The distinct adhesive properties seemingly originate from the unique adhesive tasks that each of the floral parts requires to achieve successful pollination. The insights into the adhesive interaction between pollen and the floral parts, obtained in the present study, may lead to better understanding of pollination mechanisms, which are strongly related to our food production. Additionally, the novel pollen adhesive mechanisms learned from the stigma of the studied Asteraceae plant can inspire biomimetic designs of spontaneous gripping systems.",0.013487233,0.006626457,0.00800201,0.021065967,0.008575973,0.008112859,0.005006748,0.013480497,0.017511345,0.9050539,0.005429072,0.05528726,0.00685904,0.03176452,0.035913147,0.007433954,0.007410478,0.010391692,0.048001435,0.007979056,0.004331796,0.015157213,0.008182653,0.015051597,0.010265603,0.010745275,0.008737637,0.02155304,0.018310498,[],[],[]

As the source of defensive chemical production and storage, the pygidial gland system experiences severe chemical stress which challenges the integrity of the entire gland system. Here, we utilize autofluorescence-based confocal laser scanning microscopy to examine the morphology of pygidial gland secretory lobes and collecting ductules in a common Pennsylvanian harpaline species, Harpalus pensylvanicus. The glandular units are composed of type-III exocrine cells which empty into resilin-rich ductules, which themselves lead into a larger resilin-rich collecting duct, and ultimately the pygidial reservoir pump. We also utilize histological staining with toluidine blue and brightfield imaging to provide additional support for the presence of resilin in the collecting duct, as toluidine blue has been shown to stain resilin without metachromasia. We hypothesize that the high resilin content of the collecting ducts might be a widespread key evolutionary adaptation to prevent damage caused by physical and chemical stress generated in pump-containing insect exocrine gland systems.",0.01729921,0.00157415,0.014458468,0.010874345,0.037449453,0.001938802,0.002381766,0.020930054,0.015450919,0.007742345,0.07878237,0.005763107,0.020592403,0.009563464,0.014461241,0.008561127,0.001953083,0.006138607,0.057754137,0.002419827,0.005998229,0.005350648,0.005018492,0.00736984,0.005745804,0.006899955,0.003023566,0.005967364,0.003921777,[],[],[]
