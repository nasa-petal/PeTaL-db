The principles on which the technology is based, inspired by the natural spinning system of silkworms and spiders, are presented, as well as some of the main achievements of the technique. Among these achievements, spinning under environmentally friendly conditions, obtaining high-performance fibers, and imparting the fibers with emerging properties such as supercontraction are discussed. Consequently, SFS appears as an efficient process that may represent one of the first realizations of a biomimetic technology with a significant impact at the production level.Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad MAT2016-75544-C2-1-RMinisterio de Economía y Competitividad MAT2016-79832-RMinisterio de Economía y Competitividad CPI2016-78887-C3-1-RComunidad de Madrid NEUROCENTRO-B2017Comunidad de Madrid BMD-376"

In flow mediated environments, in addition to visual cues, pressure and shear sensors on the fish body are critical for providing quantitative information that assists the quantification of proximity to other swimmers. Here we examine the distribution of sensors on the surface of an artificial swimmer so that it can optimally identify a leading group of swimmers. We employ Bayesian experimental design coupled with two-dimensional Navier Stokes equations for multiple self-propelled swimmers. The follower tracks the school using information from its own surface pressure and shear stress. We demonstrate that the optimal sensor distribution of the follower is qualitatively similar to the distribution of neuromasts on fish. Our results show that it is possible to identify accurately the center of mass and even the number of the leading swimmers using surface only information"

The proteins present on the mussel's foot contain 3,4-dihydroxy-l-alanine (DOPA), an amino acid from the catechol family that has been reported by their adhesive character. Therefore, we synthesized a mussel-inspired conjugated polymer, modifying the backbone of hyaluronic acid with dopamine by carbodiimide chemistry. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques confirmed the success of this modification. Different techniques have been reported to produce two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) systems capable to support cells and tissue regeneration; among others, multilayer systems allow the construction of hierarchical structures from nano- to macroscales. In this study, the layer-by-layer (LbL) technique was used to produce freestanding multilayer membranes made uniquely of chitosan and dopamine-modified hyaluronic acid (HA-DN). The electrostatic interactions were found to be the main forces involved in the film construction. The surface morphology, chemistry, and mechanical properties of the freestanding membranes were characterized, confirming the enhancement of the adhesive properties in the presence of HA-DN. The MC3T3-E1 cell line was cultured on the surface of the membranes, demonstrating the potential of these freestanding multilayer systems to be used for bone tissue engineering.publishe"

                        "S": "The study of compounds able to interfere in various ways with amyloid aggregation is of paramount importance in amyloid research. Molecules characterized by a 4-thiaflavane skeleton have received great attention in chemical, medicinal, and pharmaceutical research. Such molecules, especially polyhydroxylated 4-thiaflavanes, can be considered as structural mimickers of several natural polyphenols that have been previously demonstrated to bind and impair amyloid fibril formation. In this work, we tested five different 4-thiaflavanes on the hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL) amyloid model for their potential anti-amyloid properties. By combining a thioflavin T assay, atomic force microscopy, and a cell toxicity assay, we demonstrated that such compounds can impair the formation of high-order amyloid aggregates and mature fibrils. Despite this, the tested 4-thiaflavanes, although non-toxic per se, are not able to prevent amyloid toxicity on human neuroblastoma cells. Rather, they proved to block early aggregates in a stable, toxic conformation. Accordingly, 4-thiaflavanes can be proposed for further studies aimed at identifying blocking agents for the study of toxicity mechanisms of amyloid aggregation. "

Recently, it has been shown that jumping spiders perform this estimation based on image defocus cues. In order to gain insight into the mechanisms involved in this blur-to-distance mapping as performed by the spider and to judge whether inspirations can be drawn from spider vision for depth-from-defocus computer vision algorithms, we constructed a three-dimensional (3D) model of the anterior median eye of the Metaphidippus aeneolus, a well studied species of jumping spider. We were able to study images of the environment as the spider would see them and to measure the performances of a well known depth-from-defocus algorithm on this dataset. We found that the algorithm performs best when using images that are averaged over the considerable thickness of the spider’s receptor layers, thus pointing towards a possible functional role of the receptor thickness for the spider’s depth estimation capabilities.Peer Reviewe"

Paramecia use waves of ciliary beating for locomotion, intake of food particles and sensing. There is some evidence that Paramecia pre-sort food particles by discarding larger particles, but intake the particles matching their mouth cavity.Most prior attempts to mimic cilia-based manipulation merely mimicked the overall action rather than the beating of cilia. The majority of massive-parallel actuators are controlled by a central computer; however, a distributed control would be far more true-to-life. We propose and test a distributed parallel cilia platform where each actuating unit is autonomous, yet exchanging information with its closest neighboring units. The units are arranged in a hexagonal array. Each unit is a tileable circuit board, with a microprocessor, color-based object sensor and servo-actuated biomimetic cilia actuator.Localized synchronous communication between cilia allowed for the emergence of coordinated action, moving different colored objects together. The coordinated beating action was capable of moving objects up to 4 cm/s at its highest beating frequency; however, objects were moved at a speed proportional to the beat frequency. Using the local communication, we were able to detect the shape of objects and rotating an object using edge detection was performed; however, lateral manipulation using shape information was unsuccessful"

                        "S": "The covalent functionalization of surfaces with molecules capable of providing new properties to the treated substrate, such as hydrophobicity or bioactivity, has been attracting a lot of interest in the last decades. For achieving this goal, the generation of a universally functionalizable primer coating in one-pot reaction and under relatively mild conditions is especially attractive due to its potential versatility and ease of application. The aim of the present work is to obtain such a functionalizable coating by a cross-linking reaction between pyrocatechol and hexamethylenediamine (HDMA) under oxidizing conditions. For demonstrating the efficacy of this approach, different substrates (glass, gold, silicon, and fabric) have been coated and later functionalized with two different alkylated species (1-hexadecanamine and stearoyl chloride). The success of their attachment has been demonstrated by evaluating the hydrophobicity conferred to the surface by contact angle measurements. Interestingly, these results, together with its chemical characterization by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), have proven that the reactivity of the primer coating towards the functionalizing agent can be tuned in function of its generation time"

To address the question of when a layer is sufficiently thin to become adhesive, we extended Green’s function molecular dynamics (GFMD) to account for the finite thickness of an elastic body that is supported by a fluid foundation. We observed that thin layers can much better accommodate rough counterfaces than thick structures. As a result, the contact area is enlarged, in particular, when the width of the layer w approaches or even falls below the short-wavelength cutoff λs of the surface spectra. In the latter case, the proportionality coefficient between area and load scales is (w/λs)3 , which is consistent with Persson’s contact mechanics theory"

In this work, we test both the functionality of the novel hardware’s components as well as the device’s capabilities in locomotion tasks. We also observe the trajectories and patterns emerging from different initial states of the CA excitation and hardware configurations. Two main result sets emerge from this study: the first set illustrates different trajectories according to different initial excitation of the physical CA controller layer. The second set suggests the potential of the developed platform for generating complex patterns of control, as well as indicating emergent characteristics similar to those common to morphological computation approaches in generating localized perturbations without affecting or notifying the central controller"

Strategies include wraps, meshes, cardiac patches, or fluid-filled bladders. Here, we review the literature describing these strategies in the two broad categories of global restraint and local reinforcement. We further subdivide the global restraint category into biventricular and univentricular support. We discuss efforts to optimize devices in each of these categories, particularly in the last five years. These include adding functionality, biomimicry, and adjustability. We also discuss computational models of these strategies, and how they can be used to predict the reduction of stresses in the heart muscle wall. We discuss the range of timing of intervention that has been reported. Finally, we give a perspective on how novel fabrication technologies, imaging techniques, and computational models could potentially enhance these therapeutic strategies.

Insecticides represent an effective way to control pest insects but are harmful to the environment. As an eco-friendlier alternative, we have formulated waterborne, organic paints which provided a slippery physical barrier for leafcutter ants (Atta cephalotes) on vertical surfaces. Different paints were produced by varying the Pigment Volume Concentration (PVC) and amount of TiO2 and CaCO3 particles, and characterised in terms of contact angles, surface roughness and scrub resistance. The paints’ slipperiness for A. cephalotes ants was evaluated in climbing tests on vertical paint panels (by recording the percentage of fallen ants). Two main factors reduced the insects’ attachment to vertical paint surfaces: (1) the PVC: in paints above a critical PVC, more loose particles detach from the coating and thereby reduce insect attachment; and (2) the type, dimensions and shape of solid particles: CaCO3 particles detach more easily from the paint than TiO2, probably due to their larger size and platelet shape. Paints formulated at PVC 70 and containing 20 wt% CaCO3 showed the best performance in terms of slipperiness, as well as providing good scrub resistance."

The generated paints with nanotechnology perform better in laboratory tests with respect to fouling and corrosion and test carried out via painting commercial ship traveling across the Adriatic Sea for a year than the currently used commercial paints. This is another application of nanotechnology that will someday find a commercial application. Since copper oxide is used for the current commercial paints and bromosphaerol is a natural biocide, there will be no need to pass the expensive approvals to use these antifoulants."

The active materials encapsulated into the nanocontainers with controlled shell permeability have been first applied for self-healing coatings with controlled release of the corrosion inhibitor. The nanocontainers have been added to the paint formulation matrix at 5-10 % wt. concentration, which resulted in attaining coating autonomous self-healing ability. This research idea has attracted attention of many scientists across the world (>1500 publications during last 10 years) and has already been transferred to the commercialization level. The current trend in nanocontainer-based active systems is devoted to the multifunctionality of the capsules which can combine self-healing, antibacterial, thermal and other functionalities in one host matrix. This paper summarizes the previous research done in the CORE Metadata, citation and similar papers at core.ac.uk Provided by University of Liverpool Repository 2 area of the nanocontainer-based active materials together with future perspectives of the capsulebased materials with antifouling or thermo-regulating activity."

The development of the nanocontainer-based self-healing coatings has been started 15 years ago from the study of the nanocontainers with stimuli responsive release properties able to release anticorrosion agent (inhibitor) on demand only into corroded area thus preventing its spontaneous leakage. Since that, many different types of the nanocontainers have been demonstrated: from polymer capsules to the porous inorganic nanoparticles with sophisticated mechanism of the release triggering. Nowadays, the study of the commercial application of the nanocontainer-based selfhealing coatings is the main focus in this area, especially for the coatings with several autonomic functionalities. However, the search for the new types of the multifunctional nanocontainers possessing different triggering mechanisms is still remained active, especially for low-cost natural nanocontainers."

                        "S": "Development of materials possessing the ability to recover their main function(s) in response to destructive impacts is today one of most rapidly growing fields in the material science. In particular, protective organic coatings with the features to heal or restore their protective function autonomously are of great interest in fighting surface deterioration processes like corrosion, biofouling and other affecting metallic structures.  Embedding of micro- and nanocontainers in protective coatings is nowadays frequently used technique to provide them one or several feedback active functionalities. Depending on containers morphology and active agent(s) filled, coatings with specifically aimed self-recovering functionalities (anticorrosive, water-repelling, antifouling etc.) or multifunctional coatings can be created. In the present paper, different types of containers for self-recovering functional coatings synthesized by use of mesoporous nano- and microparticles or on the emulsion basis are presented. L-b-L polyelectrolyte deposition, interfacial polymerization, surface precipitation, Pickering emulsions and in-situ emulsion polymerization were utilized for the preparation of nano- or microscaled containers. Morphology of containers, efficiency of encapsulation and kinetics of active agents release were investigated using modern techniques such as T-SEM, Cryo-SEM etc.  Incorporation of containers in the coating matrix was followed by the experimental modeling of external impacts leading to the simultaneous containers damage. Subsequent release of the active agent at the affected site caused the active feedback of the coating and self-recovery of its specific protective function. The advantages of novel container based protective coatings as compared to conventional ones are illustrated by corrosion tests results according to ASTM Standard B 117"

                        "S": "Feedback coating based on pH-induced release of inhibitor from organosilyl-functionalized containers is considered as a compelling candidate to achieve smart self-healing corrosion protection. Four key factors that determine the overall coating performance include 1) the uptake and release capacity of containers, 2) prevention of the premature leakage, 3) compatibility of containers in coating matrix and 4) cost and procedure simplicity consideration. The critical influence introduced by organosilyl-functionalization of containers is systematically demonstrated by investigating MCM-41 silica nanoparticles modified with ethylenediamine (en), en-4-oxobutanoic acid salt (en-COO-) and en-triacetate (en-(COO-)3) with higher and lower organic contents. The properties of the modified silica nanoparticles as containers were mainly characterized by solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, N2 sorption, thermogravimetric analysis, small-angle X-ray scattering, dynamic light scattering and UV-vis spectroscopy. Finally, the self-healing ability and anticorrosive performances of hybrid coatings were examined through scanning vibrating electrode technique (SVET) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). en-(COO-)3- type functionalization with content of only 0.23 mmol/g was found to perform the best as a candidate for establishing pH-induced release system. It is because the resulting capped and loaded (C-L) functionalized silica nanocontainers (FSNs) exhibit a high loading (26 wt%) and release capacity (80%) for inhibitor, prevention of premature leakage (less than 2%), good dispersibility in coating matrix and cost effectiveness"

                        "S": "Application of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) as antifouling/antibacterial carriers is limited and specifically with a dual synergetic effect. In the present work, MSNs modified with quaternary ammonium salts (QASs) and loaded with the biocide Parmetol S15 were synthesized as functional fillers for antifouling/antibacterial coatings. From the family of the MSNs, MCM-48 was selected as a carrier because of its cubic pore structure, high surface area, and high specific pore volume. The QASs used for the surface modification of MCM-48 were dimethyloctadecyl[3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]ammonium chloride and dimethyltetradecyl[3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl]ammonium chloride. The QAS-modified MCM-48 reveals strong covalent bonds between the QAS and the surface of the nanoparticles. The surface functionalization was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, elemental analysis, and ζ-potential measurements. Additional loading of the QAS-modified MCM-48 with a commercially available biocide (Parmetol S15) resulted in a synergetic dual antibacterial/antifouling effect. Either loaded or unloaded QAS-modified MSNs exhibited high antibacterial performance confirming their dual activity. The QAS-modified MCM-48 loaded with the biocide Parmetol S15 killed all exposed bacteria after 3 h of incubation and presented 100% reduction at the antibacterial tests against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Furthermore, the QAS-modified MCM-48 without Parmetol S15 presented 77–89% reduction against the exposed Gram-negative bacteria and 78–94% reduction against the exposed Gram-positive bacteria. In addition, the modified MCM-48 was mixed with coating formulations, and its antifouling performance was assessed in a field test trial in northern Red Sea. All synthesized paints presented significant antifouling properties after 5 months of exposure in real seawater conditions, and the dual antifouling effect of the nanoparticles was confirmed"

                        "S": "Since 1970, a major problem worldwide is energy shortage along with the high consumption of energy in buildings. Architects are attempting to find solutions for managing buildings energy consumption. One innovative approach is Biomimicry,Which is defined as the applied science that derives inspiration for solutions to human problems through the study of natural designs, systems, and process2. A subcategory of biomimicry is building skin which forms the entire exterior of the building. It is the boundary through which the buildings interaction with the environment occurs. Proper management of the building skin can significantly reduce the building's energy demand. The main objective of this paper is to investigate the ability of reducing energy consumption by applying the biomimicry approach on buildings skin design. In order To achieve this aim, a research methodology has been designed to accomplish four objectives. First, it will carry out an in depth research on biomimicry, skin, and biomimicry in building skin through the study of existing literature. Second, international case studies will be presented and analyzed in terms of usage of biomimicry, in addition to, the impact it had on reducing the buildings energy consumption. Finally it will conclude with guidelines for building skin biomimicry design for more efficient energy consumption in buildings"

The Industrial Revolution 4.0 brought many changes in human life, changes in lifestyles, ways of working, ways of learning, and ways of communicating between humans in many aspects. Most University students make use of technology to find and develop their ideas especially in creative industries where the OIM (Observe, Imitate, Modify) practice can be done through the Internet by observing from another researcher's observation. While biomimicry offers researchers to observe nature and create technology innovation inspired by nature. Students need to experience and learn from nature and use technology wisely. This study examines the biomimicryinspired works of Product Design undergraduate program students of Podomoro University Jakarta. The methodology research that we use in this study is a qualitative participatory method with comparative and correlational studies. The content of this study is to learn and evaluate the process and result of student's biomimicry observation into innovative product design. The conclusion can also be drawn that comparing the different levels of students which is the first year, second year, and third-year students by using the biomimicry observation approach will show variated concepts and skills on their work depending on what knowledge that they have learned from each semester."

A promising alternative to biocide containing antifouling paints are fouling-release coatings, which are non-toxic and designed to prevent permanent attachment of marine organisms to the surface, due to their low surface energy. However, these coatings suffer from insufficient mechanical properties, which make them unsuitable for mechanically stressed surfaces e.g., on ship hulls. To overcome those obstacles, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-polythiourethane (PTU) composites modified with tetrapodal shaped micro-nano ZnO particles (t-ZnO) were produced and characterized by evaluating the surface energy, mechanical properties, and fouling-release performance. Among all variations, PTU/1 wt.% PDMS composites with 1 wt.% t-ZnO particles possess superior properties for applications as fouling-release coatings for maritime purposes"

In this work, an ecofriendly series of lotus‐like nano‐structured organic‐inorganic surfaces based on vinyl terminated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)/ϒ‐Al2O3 nanorods composites were successfully modeled for the first time via in‐situ technique. The tailored nanocomposites were cured via hydrosilation mechanism and applied for marine FR coatings. Incorporation of various concentrations of controlled 1D nanofillers was inevitable to study the structure property relationship. Mechanical tests, durability parameters, and the FR and biological inertness were assessed. The results confirmed that uniform distribution of the prepared ϒ‐Al2O3 nanorods dramatically improved their water repellency, homogenous topology, self‐cleaning and fouling repellency. With nanofiller insertion up to 0.5% nanofillers, a particular increase in the contact angle (CA), decrease in the surface free energy (SFE), and topological homogeneity was observed with improving phsico‐mechanical, and durability against UV properties. The biological assessments indicated excellent inhibition and superior AF potential of the 0.5% nanofiller composite coatings. Our finding introduces attractive merits such as simplicity, ecofriendly, economic feasibility, and potential application in marine FR nano‐coatings"

Objective four is to develop the framework based on the biomimicry rules for human evolution and survival in the natural environment. Methodology To achieve objective one, the grounded theory method was applied for scrutinizing human development and human awareness about their natural environment. To achieve objective two, an evidence study was conducted on the biomimicry emulation of nature's genius. To achieve objective three, a critical literature review was conducted using content analysis method to identify the biomimicry focus and architectural features. Through matrix development method, the focus and architectural features were tabulated. To achieve objective four, the waterfall framework design method and case studies were conducted to plot this framework. Conclusions This research gained a better understanding of biomimicry-based on theories of the evolution of organisms, including humans in the urban context, as measurement against sustainable benchmarks. It followed the paths of ecological researcher and urban philosophers, such as Freya Mathews and Moore, by re-versioned the human relationship with nature and the surrounding environment and observing human actions and development about life principles.In particular, the research found out that biomimicry is an approach that recently becomes the focus of many researchers of different disciplines seeking a solution for human problems. The biomimicry has been merged with sustainable architecture design through specific features; included, form and function, geometry, metaphor, movement, material, pattern, proportion, sustainability, and technology. Furthermore, biomimicry is an approach that involves nature as a model, mentor, and measure for inspiration, which converges law, principles, and strategies in the context of biomimicry-based on human evolution. Originality The findings allowed architects and urban designers to enhance people's awareness of their natural environment and provide a better perception of biomimicry in the application of human world, whether founded because of base instinct or a strategic view derived from the life's principles.The authors would like to thank the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation (MOSTI) for funding this research via the grant number PY/2015/04995.Scopu"

Biomimicry does  catch the attention of human to study more on the system and function of its nature  course. The designers are not exception influenced by this concept when the form, shape,  texture and colour inspired them in their design. The domination of building form will  affect the building envelope as the skin of the structure. A clear impact on building failure  is begun with building envelope appearance without a proper maintenance. The faults in  building design place a heavy burden on the building for the rest of its operational life and  there is no compensation for it.

                        "S": "A number of innovations in building envelope technologies have been implemented recently, for example, to improve insulation and air tightness to reduce energy consumption. However, growing concern over the embodied energy and carbon as well as resource depletion, is beginning to impact on the design and implementation of existing and novel building envelope technologies. Biomimicry is proposed as one approach to create buildings which are resilient to a changing climate, embedded in wider ecological systems, energy efficient and waste free. However, the diversity of form and function in biological organisms and therefore potential applications for biomimicry, requires a holistic approach spanning biology, materials science and architecture. It is considered timely to re-examine opportunities to learn from nature, including in the light of recent understanding of how plant form and function are determined at the cellular levels. In this article, we call for a systemic approach for the development of innovative biological and living building envelopes. Plant cell walls are compared to building envelopes. Key features of cell walls with the potential to inform the development of design principles of biological and living building envelopes are identified and discussed"

                        "S": "Condensation of water on metallic surfaces is critical for multiple energy conversion processes. Enhancement in condensation heat transfer efficiency often requires surface texturing and hydrophobicity, usually achieved through coatings, to maintain dropwise condensation. However, such surface treatments face conflicting challenges of minimal coating thermal resistance, enhanced coating durability and scalable fabrication. Here we present a thin (~ 2 {\\mu}m) polytetrafluoroethylene - carbon nanofiber nanocomposite coating which meets these challenges and sustains coalescence-induced jumping droplet condensation for extended periods under highly demanding condensation conditions. Coating durability is achieved through improved substrate adhesion by depositing a sub-micron thick aluminum primer layer. Carbon nanofibers in a polytetrafluoroethylene matrix increase coating thermal conductivity and promote spontaneous surface nano-texturing to achieve superhydrophobicity for condensate microdroplets. The coating material can be deposited through direct spraying, ensuring economical scalability and versatility for a wide range of substrates. We know of no other coating for metallic surfaces that is able to sustain jumping dropwise condensation under shear of steam at 111 degC flowing at ~ 3 m s-1 over the surface for 10 hours and dropwise condensation for an additional 50 hours. Up to ~ 900% improvement in condensation heat transfer coefficient is achieved compared to conventional filmwise condensation"

                        "S": "This article investigates the influence of the thermal performance of building envelopes on annual energy consumption in a ground-buried office building by means of the dynamic building energy simulation, aiming at offering reasonable guidelines for the energy efficient design of envelopes for underground office buildings in China. In this study, the accuracy of dealing with the thermal process for underground buildings by using the Designer's Energy Simulation Tool (DeST) is validated by measured data. The analyzed results show that the annual energy consumptions for this type of buildings vary significantly, and it is based on the value of the overall heat transfer coefficient (U-value) of the envelopes. Thus, it is necessary to optimize the U-value for underground buildings located in various climatic zones in China. With respect to the roof, an improvement in its thermal performance is significantly beneficial to the underground office building in terms of annual energy demand. With respect to the external walls, the optimized U-values completely change with the distribution of the climate zones. The recommended optimal values for various climate zones of China are also specified as design references for public office building in underground in terms of the building energy efficiency"

                        "S": "The UK National Health Service (NHS) is continually under pressure to provide more bed spaces and to do this within a tight budget. Therefore, NHS Trusts may turn to modular buildings, which promise faster construction and low energy demands helping the NHS meet its stringent energy targets. However, there is growing evidence that thermally lightweight, well insulated and naturally ventilated dwellings are at risk of overheating during warm UK summers.  This paper examines the energy demands and internal temperatures in two 16-bed hospital wards built in 2008?at Bradford Royal Infirmary in northern England using modular fast track methods. The two-storey building used ceiling-mounted radiant panels and a mix of natural and mechanical ventilation with heat recovery to condition patients' rooms. Monitoring showed that the annual energy demand was 289?kWh/m2 ±16%, which is below the NHS guidelines for new hospital buildings.  It was observed that the criterion given in Department of Health Technical Memorandum HTM03-01 can lead to the incorrect diagnosis of overheating risk in existing buildings. Assessment using other static and adaptive overheating criteria showed that patient rooms and the nurses' station overheated in summer. To maintain patient safety, temporary air conditioning units had to be installed during the warmest weather.  It is concluded that thermally lightweight, well insulated, naturally ventilated hospital wards can be low-energy but are at risk of overheating even in relatively cool UK summer conditions and that this needs to be addressed before such buildings can be recommended for wider adoption"

The electrochemical properties of the samples were assessed experimentally, employing potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The potentiodynamic polarization results indicated that coatings produced by S-HVOF technique show lower corrosion resistance compared with the coatings produced by HVOF-JK (HVOF Jet Kote) and HVOF-JP (HVOF JP5000) techniques.

Balancing the thermal needs of patients, staff, and visitors is a challenging, complex endeavour. A case study of the ultrasound area of the Royal Berkshire Hospital’s Maternity and Gynaecology building is presented, where temperatures were measured for 35 days in waiting areas, staff offices, and ultrasound scanning rooms, aiming to assess the overheating risk posed to occupants. Local external temperature measurements were used for comparison whereby determining the indoor-outdoor environmental connection. Results show that most rooms had already breached standard overheating thresholds within the study period. Anthropogenic and waste heat from equipment has a noticeable effect on indoor temperatures. Local air-conditioning helped reduce the peaks in temperature seen between 14:00 and 17:00 for similar scanning rooms but is in contradiction to the National Health Service’s sustainability plans. Several low-level solutions such as improved signage, access to water, and the allocation of vulnerable patients to morning clinics are suggested. Barriers to solutions are also discussed and the requirement of sufficient maintenance plans for cooling equipment is empathised. These solutions are likely to be applicable to other hospital buildings experiencing similar conditions"

                        "S": "Historically, high carbon steels have been used in mechanical applications because their high surface hardness contributes to excellent wear performance. However, in aggressive environments, current bearing steels exhibit insufficient corrosion resistance. Martensitic stainless steels are attractive for bearing applications due to their high corrosion resistance and ability to be surface hardened via carburizing heat treatments. Here three different carburizing heat treatments were applied to UNS S42670: a high-temperature temper (HTT), a low-temperature temper (LTT), and carbo-nitriding (CN). Magnetic force microscopy showed differences in magnetic domains between the matrix and carbides, while scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy (SKPFM) revealed a 90–200 mV Volta potential difference between the two phases. Corrosion progression was monitored on the nanoscale via SKPFM and in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM), revealing different corrosion modes among heat treatments that predicted bulk corrosion behavior in electrochemical testing. HTT outperforms LTT and CN in wear testing and thus is recommended for non-corrosive aerospace applications, whereas CN is recommended for corrosion-prone applications as it exhibits exceptional corrosion resistance. The results reported here support the use of scanning probe microscopy for predicting bulk corrosion behavior by measuring nanoscale surface differences in properties between carbides and the surrounding matrix"

However, large variability in measured VPD values for metallic phases has led to controversy in their interpretation. Tracking changes of the probe work function has been shown to decrease the variability seen in SKPFM results. To quantify the work function of SKPFM probes, the measured VPD of an inert gold standard was compared to the work function theoretically calculated by density functional theory (DFT) first-principles.

The introduction of cold work reduced the difference between both phases, but the development of local extremes in Volta potential was observed. Microstructure analysis revealed the presence of larger misorientation concentrations at these sites, which can explain the changes in observed corrosion behaviour, from selective dissolution in the annealed condition to localised corrosion attack after cold-rolling"

Phase and elemental composition across each braze and parent metal interface was characterized and scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy (SKPFM) was used to map the Volta potential differences. Co-localization of SKPFM with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) measurements enabled spatially resolved correlation of potential differences with composition and subsequent galvanic corrosion behavior. Following exposure to the aggressive solution, corrosion damage morphology was characterized to determine the mode of attack and likely initiation areas. When exposed to 0.6 M NaCl, corrosion occurred at the braze-316L interface preceded by preferential dissolution of the Cu-rich phase within the braze alloy. Braze corrosion was driven by galvanic couples between the braze alloys and stainless steel as well as between different phases within the braze microstructure. Microgalvanic corrosion between phases of the braze alloys was investigated via SKPFM to determine how corrosion of the brazed joints developed"

                        "S": "Recently, retrofit of tower blocks has gained momentum particularly in the UK social housing sector due to the increasing rate of fuel poverty coupled with deteriorating indoor living conditions. However, the process of making improvements to the thermal performance of building envelopes can significantly impact on occupants’ thermal comfort, increasing overheating risks with the changing climate and associated heat waves. The first phase of the study evaluated the building energy performance of a 1960s social housing tower block prototype in London, pre-retrofit, where the building simulation model was created and calibrated with monitored indoor data and occupants’ interviews. The second research phase, the subject of this paper, uses the model to further investigate the impact of improved thermal insulation of the building envelope, based on U-values prescribed by the UK Building Regulations (Part L1B), on the potential risk of overheating. The study investigates the impact of retrofitting on occupants’ thermal comfort and building energy performance in the current and future climate scenarios (2030, 2050 and 2080). Results confirm that improving the U-value of external walls will significantly reduce the heating energy use by 70% under future climate scenarios while the Tₒ increases by 15-17% with U-value of 0.5 W/m²K and 0.3 W/m²K in comparison to the base case. The overall results indicate that the different occupancy patterns adopted in the simulation model have a significant impact on the predicted duration of overheating which will, in turn, have an impact on determining appropriate retrofit strategies to reduce overheating risks"

                        "S": "In the drive to reduce space-heating demand and associated CO2 emissions as well as tackle fuel poverty, dwelling overheating and summer-time occupant thermal discomfort might be the unintended consequences of low-energy building retrofits. This paper presents the findings of a steady-state modelled low energy retrofit dwelling in northern England and its potential current and future climate overheating risks using UK Climate Projections 2009 (UKCP09) scenarios (2050 and 2080 High Emission Scenarios). Predictive findings highlight that retrofitting to low energy standards increases overheating risk over time, unless passive prevention measures are included in the retrofit design. In addition, the steady-state nature of the model might not fully capture the occupants’ exposure to actual future overheating risks. Among the most effective individual passive overheating mitigation strategies are temporary internal shading, permanent external shading, and night-time ventilation. Most effective is a combination of these adaptation measures, so that predictive overheating is minimised in a future changing climate, reducing the uptake of active cooling in retrofitted dwellings. Practical applications: Much research focuses on building overheating risks in the warmer South-east of England. However, this paper highlights how dwelling retrofit in north England (Sheffield) also can lead to increased dwelling overheating risk, unless passive design measures are included in the retrofit design. Among the most effective individual passive overheating mitigation strategies are solar shading devices and increased night-time ventilation, though ideally different measures are combined. Using future climate scenarios highlights that retrofits designed today might not be able to provide occupant thermal comfort in a future warming world"

Among others, these include a low energy consumption, an accurate dosage, a good brazeability, a short production time, and a high production efficiency. These filler metals have been used in the aerospace, automobile, and electric appliances industries. The PBFMs are especially suitable for diamond tools bonding, which involves complex workpiece shapes and requires accurate dosage. The recent research of PBFMs for diamond tools is reviewed in this paper. The current applications are discussed. The CuSnTi and Ni-Cr-based PBFMs have been the two commonly used monolayer PBFMs. Thus, the bonding mechanism at the interface between both the monolayer PBFMs and a diamond tool are summarized first. The ways to improve the performance of the monolayer PBFMs for diamond tools are analyzed. Next, a research of PBFMs for impregnated diamond tools is reviewed. The technical problems that urgently need solutions are discussed. Finally, the challenges and opportunities involved with the PBFMs for diamond tools research and development are summarized, and corresponding prospects are suggested"

                        "S": "Invertebrates are commonly ignored in conservation planning due to their vast diversity, difficulties with species identification, a poor understanding of their spatial patterns, and the impracticability of carrying out comprehensive sampling. Conservation planning for fauna is therefore often based on patterns of diversity and distribution of vertebrates, under the assumption that these are representative of animal diversity more generally. Here, we evaluate how well vertebrates act as umbrellas for invertebrate diversity and distribution in a highly diverse tropical savanna landscape, and we investigate the effect of vertebrate sampling intensity (i.e., number of surveys) on congruence results. We assessed congruence between each of the four classes of terrestrial vertebrates (amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals) and twelve invertebrate families (representing four dominant invertebrate taxa: ants, beetles, flies, and spiders) by applying a range of modeling approaches to analyze patterns of cross‐taxon congruence in species richness and composition across sampling sites. To investigate drivers of congruence, we applied generalized and distance‐based linear models to identify environmental associations of richness and composition for each taxon, then examined variation in environmental associations across taxa. Vertebrate and invertebrate richness was weakly (<30%) associated, and ~60% of the significant associations were negative. Correlations in species composition between vertebrate and invertebrate taxa were also weak, with a maximum of 13% congruence. In most cases, pairwise correlation scores using data from single surveys of vertebrates were only marginally lower than those from multiple surveys. Poor among‐site congruence between vertebrates and invertebrates was reflected by marked variation among taxa in their environmental associations. Our findings show that vertebrates are poor umbrellas for invertebrates in the tropical savannas of northern Australia in terms of geographic patterns of diversity and distribution and that this is not just an artifact of low vertebrate sampling intensity. Our study is one of the most comprehensive regional analyses of the congruence of vertebrate and invertebrate diversity, and it significantly adds to the growing evidence that empirical data on invertebrate diversity and distribution are required for conservation planning that effectively protects all faunal diversity"

                        "S": "Few studies of global diversity gradients in plants exist, largely because the data are not available for all species involved. Instead, most global studies have focussed on vertebrates, as these taxa have historically been associated with the most complete data. Here, we address this shortfall by first investigating global diversity gradients in monocots, a morphologically and functionally diverse clade representing a quarter of flowering plant diversity, and then assessing congruence between monocot and vertebrate diversity patterns. To do this, we create a new dataset that merges biome-level associations for all monocot genera with country-level associations for almost all ∼70,000 species. We then assess the evidence for direct versus indirect effects of this plant diversity on vertebrate diversity using a combination of linear regression and structural equation modelling (SEM). Finally, we also calculate overlap of diversity hotspots for monocots and each vertebrate taxon. Monocots follow a latitudinal gradient although with pockets of extra-tropical diversity, mirroring patterns in vertebrates. Monocot diversity is positively associated with vertebrate diversity, but the strength of correlation varies depending on the clades being compared. Monocot diversity explains marginal amounts of variance (<10%) after environmental factors have been accounted for. However, correlations remain among model residuals, and SEMs apparently reveal some direct effects of monocot richness. Our results suggest that collinear responses to environmental gradients are behind much of the congruence observed, but that there is some evidence for direct effects of producer diversity on consumer diversity. Much remains to be done before broad-scale diversity gradients among taxa are fully explained. Our dataset of monocot distributions will aid in this endeavour"

We recorded 302 species belonging to 51 families. Ferns and lycophytes contributed 62% of the species, followed by monocots with 24% and dicots with 14%. Overall herb species richness did not show any particular relation with elevation, while the richness of ferns increased significantly with elevation, monocots did not show a pattern, and dicots showed a hump-shaped pattern with maximum richness at 1800m. These patterns in turn were only partly reflected in the patterns of the individual plant families making up each group. The independence of different taxa was also reflected in their relationships to environmental factors (temperature, precipitation, and area): although, each single family was related to one or several factors, at the group level and at the overall level these trends were lost. These results show that interpreting diversity at higher taxonomic level may overlook important information at the family level and raises the biologically intriguing question whether overall patterns of diversity result from a random accumulation of group-specific patterns or if there is some interaction between groups (e.g., via competition and niche-pre-emption"

In this paper, richness and composition of terrestrial herb assemblages is compared in tropical forests of America, Africa and South East Asia. We established 86 non-continuous transects of 445m each. Herb species richness was analysed and compared to six environmental parameters using minimal adequate regression models and simultaneous autoregressive models. At the global scale, we found a close relationship between herb species richness and temperature parameters, with no differences between continents. The subdivision into three main taxonomic groups (ferns, monocots, dicots) showed that each group has distinct relations to environmental factors and differences in richness between continents. Most of the 72 families found have pantropical distributions but 12, 11, and 16 families were significantly over-represented in America, Africa, and Asia, respectively. Although total species richness was closely related to climatic factors, ferns, monocots and dicots were represented by distinct sets of families with varying species richness on each continent.

                        "S": "Background Understory plants represents the largest component of biodiversity in most forest ecosystems and plays a key role in forest functioning. Despite their importance, the influence of overstory-layer composition on understory plant diversity is relatively poorly understood within deciduous-evergreen broadleaved mixed forests. The aim of this work was to evaluate how tree overstory-layer composition influences on understory-layer diversity in three forest types (monospecific deciduous Nothofagus pumilio (Np), monospecific evergreen Nothofagus betuloides (Nb), and mixed N. pumilio-N. betuloides (M) forests), comparing also between two geographical locations (coast and mountain) to estimate differences at landscape level. Results We recorded 46 plant species: 4 ferns, 12 monocots, and 30 dicots. Canopy-layer composition influences the herb-layer structure and diversity in two different ways: while mixed forests have greater similarity to evergreen forests in the understory structural features, deciduous and mixed were similar in terms of the specific composition of plant assemblage. Deciduous pure stands were the most diverse, meanwhile evergreen stands were least diverse. Lack of exclusive species of mixed forest could represent a transition where evergreen and deciduous communities meet and integrate. Moreover, landscape has a major influence on the structure, diversity and richness of understory vegetation of pure and mixed forests likely associated to the magnitude and frequency of natural disturbances, where mountain forest not only had highest herb-layer diversity but also more exclusive species. Conclusions Our study suggests that mixed Nothofagus forest supports coexistence of both pure deciduous and pure evergreen understory plant species and different assemblages in coastal and mountain sites. Maintaining the mixture of canopy patch types within mixed stands will be important for conserving the natural patterns of understory plant composition in southern beech mixed forests.Fil: Mestre, Luciana Mariel.

                        "S": "Biodiversity conservation requires knowledge about the factors that influence the structure and function of biotic assemblages. In southern Patagonian Nothofagus forests, birds are the most abundant and diverse vertebrates and are known to have different requirements for nesting, breeding and feeding. Therefore, we chose this group to analyze key drivers of avian community dynamics; for conservation purposes, this information is requisite to manage Nothofagus forest landscapes and their associated biota. We first characterized forest structure and understory floristic composition in open and closed canopy broadleaved forests of mixed deciduous (MD) and mixed deciduous-evergreen (MDE) species on the southern coast of Tierra del Fuego National Park, Argentina. For each habitat, bird assemblages were assessed using point counts, checklists and mistnetting. We used ANOVAs and multivariate methods to analyze changes in bird species richness, density, and biomass as a function of habitat and seasonal characteristics. Forest structure and understory plant communities influenced avian assemblage and density; MDE forests had significantly greater species richness, but lower density than MD. Plus, particular species were associated with specific understory conditions, such as Anairetes parulus and Zonotrichia capensis whose presence was related to shrubs. Additionally, variations observed between seasons apparently were related to differential uses of each habitat type during certain times of year. Finally, it was not possible to define a single forest type with greater conservation value for birds; each had a specific bird species assemblage. Consequently, our results suggest the importance of a full representation of habitats to preserve the region’s bird diversity, which also has been described for forest invertebrates and understory plants"

                        "S": "Overheating in the indoor environment, specifically in domestic homes, schools and healthcare settings has become of great concern to us in the UK. This is due to frequent hot weather events as a result of the continually rising global average temperatures. Overheating is a result of the heat gains associated with occupancy and solar heat gains trapped in the internal environment. The continuing rise in global average temperatures and improved insulation standards necessary to mitigate heat losses during the winter, in conjunction with poorly planned ventilation strategies, are exacerbating overheating during warmer weather conditions. In the last decade there has been a considerable improvement in reducing heat gains associated with occupancy (from lighting and equipment) thus making solar heat gains more prominent in contributing to overheating. With the rise in the number of buildings that overheat and the rise in the number of associated deaths these contribute to, it is now crucial that passive measures are utilised appropriately, and for building occupants to be educated in how to safeguard their homes against overheating. This research is centered around a real-world monitoring case study and investigates how the proposed passive measures can mitigate overheating risk. These measures include the use of different internal and external solar shading devices combined with a night-time natural ventilation strategy. This study was conducted in a south-west facing, single aspect retrofit apartment building in London between August and October 2016 and 10-minute interval data was collected during the daytime over twenty days. Throughout the monitoring period, a controlled window opening strategy was applied in rooms where differing shading strategies were implemented. In the absence of nighttime measurements, the rooms were evaluated according to CIBSE TM52 Overheating Criteria to assess the frequency and the severity of overheating and mitigation methods were statistically compared to analyse the difference in internal operative temperature increase according to the type of passive mitigation scenario implemented. The combination of opening windows at night and the closure of shading devices during the day can provide a significant thermal benefit to occupants. The inter-relationship between glazing, shading, ventilation amongst other variables need to be collectively evaluated at the building design stage to ensure the appropriate design of an effective façade management strategy"

                        "S": "Recently, retrofit of tower blocks has gained momentum particularly in the UK social housing sector due to the increasing rate of fuel poverty coupled with deteriorating indoor living conditions. However, the process of making improvements to the thermal performance of building envelopes can significantly impact on occupants’ thermal comfort, increasing overheating risks with the changing climate and associated heat waves. The first phase of the study evaluated the building energy performance of a 1960s social housing tower block prototype in London, pre-retrofit, where the building simulation model was created and calibrated with monitored indoor data and occupants’ interviews. The second research phase, the subject of this paper, uses the model to further investigate the impact of improved thermal insulation of the building envelope, based on U-values prescribed by the UK Building Regulations (Part L1B), on the potential risk of overheating. The study investigates the impact of retrofitting on occupants’ thermal comfort and building energy performance in the current and future climate scenarios (2030, 2050 and 2080). Results confirm that improving the U-value of external walls will significantly reduce the heating energy use by 70% under future climate scenarios while the Tₒ increases by 15-17% with U-value of 0.5 W/m²K and 0.3 W/m²K in comparison to the base case. The overall results indicate that the different occupancy patterns adopted in the simulation model have a significant impact on the predicted duration of overheating which will, in turn, have an impact on determining appropriate retrofit strategies to reduce overheating risks"

                        "S": "The 2011 Puyehue-Cordón Caulle volcanic eruption left vast areas of Nothofagus pumilio forests covered by high volumes of tephra, which buried the understory. This event offered a unique opportunity to analyse the impact of recent tephra deposition and the main environmental factors affecting the growth of N. pumilio seedlings. To this end, three study sites were selected and sampled three years after the eruption, two with a thick tephra layer (50 cm) but with different tree conditions: i) most trees alive or ii) most trees dead, and a third site, iii) with minimal tephra deposition. From each site, five N. pumilio 18-month-old seedlings were collected, morphometrically measured (shoot, epicotyl and main root length; shoot, epicotyl and root collar diameter), and environmental factors were also registered (light intensity, soil pH and conductivity, available P, bulk and particle soil density, and porosity). The main results indicated that three years after eruption the site with tephra deposition and dead trees (the most near to the crater) had the biggest seedlings, the lowest pH and the highest values for available P and light intensity. This temporally unique geological event showed that the regeneration potentiality of N. pumilio is high when environmental factors allow direct incident light on a substrate with high mineral content, even when the environment has previously been subjected to a significant degree of disturbance. Given the recurrence of volcanic events in northern Patagonia, this subject merits further long-term study.Fil: Moguilevsky, Denise. Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas.

Biomimicry is the study of nature’s structure, processes and systems, as models and solutions for design challenges and is being widely utilized in order to address many issues of contemporary engineering. Many academics now believe that aesthetics stem from pattern recognition, consequently, aesthetic preference may be a result of individuals recognising, and interacting with, natural patterns. The goal of this research was to investigate the impact of specific naturally occurring pattern types (spiral, branching, and fractal patterns) on user behaviour; investigating the potential of such patterns to control and influence how individuals interact with their surrounding environment. The results showed that the underlying geometry of natural patterns has the potential to induce attention responses to a statistically significant level"

There are, however, strong reasons to expect that settings made using adjustment are unintentionally influenced by extraneous variables. This paper discusses bias towards the initial anchor, the setting of the variable stimulus immediately before an adjustment is made. Specifically, the initial luminance is expected to influence the setting that is made by adjustment; for example, a lower initial luminance leads to a lower setting than a high initial luminance. To investigate anchor bias, a Hopkinson-like multiple-criterion adjustment experiment was undertaken, but with three different anchors. The results confirmed significant bias: glare settings were biased towards the luminance of the initial anchor. This demonstrates a need for caution when using adjustment to explore discomfort glare and when interpreting the results of past studies that used discomfort glare models fitted to data obtained with this procedure"

                        "S": "Research on the performance gap suggests that the actual energy consumption in buildings can be twice as much as expected from modelled estimates. Energy models rely on predictive indicators and assumptions that are usually done at the design stage, without acknowledging behavioral patterns of actual users, amongst other uncertain elements. Moreover, in the context of the performance gap, it is evident that energy efficiency is overemphasized while other key issues such as health and comfort of occupants associated with indoor air quality, noise levels etc., have been less stressed and discussed. This paper discusses physical measurements of indoor temperature in a case study building at the University of Cambridge and reports findings of a workshop with researchers, building professionals and graduate students working on environmental performance in the built environment. The workshop addressed research issues related to energy, comfort and health (couched in terms of thermal performance), used as a means to understand the complexities of and trade-off between different aspects of sustainable buildings. Retrofit measures were suggested while considering how to balance energy and comfort needs, with some these measures being modelled to determine their efficacy. This research concludes with a reflection on how to implement these retrofit measures in a manner that addresses the performance gap"

Within this framework, it is of crucial importance to guarantee the best trade-off between energy performance and indoor environmental quality (IEQ). The implications of a global refurbishment scenario on thermal and visual comfort are assessed in this paper pertaining to an existing office building. The retrofit actions applied to achieve the nZEB target consist of a combination of envelope and technical building systems refurbishment measures, involving both HVAC and lighting. Energy and comfort calculations were carried out through dynamic simulation using Energy Plus and DIVA, for the thermal and visual performance assessments, respectively. The results point out that energy retrofit actions on the building envelope would lead to significant improvements in the thermal performance, regarding both energy savings (-37% of the annual primary energy for heating) and thermal comfort. However, a daylighting reduction would occur with a consequent higher electricity demand for lighting (36%). The research presents a detailed approach applicable to further analyses aimed at optimizing the energy efficiency measures in order to reduce the imbalance between visual and thermal comfort and to ensure the best performance in both domains"

They aim at identifying the most promising building variants on the basis of diverse and potentially contrasting needs. However, optimization has been mainly used to optimize the energy performance of buildings, giving secondary importance to thermal comfort and usually neglecting visual comfort and the indoor air quality. The present study addresses the design of a detached net zero-energy house located in Southern Italy to minimize thermal and visual discomfort. The optimization problem admits four objective functions (thermal discomfort during winter and summer and visual discomfort due to glare and an inappropriate quantity of daylight) and uses the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm, implemented in the GenOpt optimization engine through the Java genetic algorithms package, to instruct the EnergyPlus simulation engine. The simulation outcome is a four-dimensional solution set. The building variants of the Pareto frontier adopt diverse and non-intuitive design alternatives. To derive good design practices, two-dimensional projections of the solution set were also analyzed. Finally, in cases of complex optimization problems with many objective functions, optimization techniques are recommended to effectively explore the large number of available building variants in a relatively short time and, hence, identify viable non-intuitive solutions"

                        "S": "In the last decades, several studies aimed at assessing some specified aspects of visual comfort characterizing the relationship between the human needs and the light environment, such as an available amount of light, light uniformity, light quality in rendering colors, and predicting the risk of glare for space occupants. For each of them, a (still growing) number of indices and metrics have been proposed in literature and standards. In the present work, they are described, categorized according to common features, and finally discussed. As in the case of long-term thermal comfort indices, such visual comfort indices and their summation over a specified calculation period might be used for driving optimization processes to support a more conscious integrated design of buildings. To that purpose, the choice among the available visual comfort indices needs to be informed by an analysis of their features and implications. We present recommendations for use, and suggest areas where improvement is needed for their use in optimization processes to support buildings’ design.© Elsevier.

                        "S": "One fifth of the electricity consumption of Swiss buildings is due to electric lighting. Integrated control of sun shading and artificial lighting can mitigate this demand while maintaining user comfort. However, the drawback of existing building control approaches is that they do not consider one of the main aspects of human-centric lighting: visual comfort.    The goal of this doctoral thesis is to develop an integrated energy efficient sun shading and electric lighting control system that incorporates widely accepted visual comfort criteria and privileges daylighting over electric lighting.    The first part is dedicated to High Dynamic Range (HDR) vision sensor calibration, programing, validation and preliminary testing. A sensor originally developed by the Centre Suisse dâElectronique et de Microtechnique (CSEM) was photometrically, spectrally and geometrically calibrated and validated with respect to reliable illuminance and multi-point luminance meters. This HDR vision sensor was then equipped with an embedded image processing routine in order to assess âon the flyâ discomfort glare indices. It has been demonstrated that the developed device, is able to serve as an enhanced visual comfort feedback sensor in building automation systems. On the other hand, it can be employed to characterize highly glazed facades and workspaces regarding visual comfort and glare risks, as demonstrated in a project in Singapore.    Two monitoring campaigns are reported in the second part of this thesis.    Firstly, 30 human subjects occupied two identical office rooms of the LESO solar experimental building for 15 afternoons to compare the performance of a fuzzy logic control system incorporating two HDR vision sensors with respect to a âbest-practiceâ controller. Subjective self-reported visual comfort surveys, paper- and computer-based visual tests and monitoring of the electric lighting consumption were carried out simultaneously in both offices. It was shown that the electricity demand of the office with the advanced controller is 32% lower than that of the reference room, while the subjectsâ visual performance remained comparable.    Secondly, an eight-month data monitoring campaign was carried out in the same building in order to study the ability of a novel control approach to maintain optimal visual and thermal comfort conditions while reducing the energy performance gap of a room as well as its electric lighting demand. The experimental results showed that the advanced controller mitigated the performance gap during the heating season by 72% with regard to standard occupant behavior and by 19% with respect to a best-practice automated system. This system reduced backup heating demand leading to lower CO2 gas emissions. At the same time, visual comfort constraints regarding Daylight Glare Probability (DGP) and workplane horizontal illuminance were respected during work hours.    Finally, a self-commissioning integrated controller for Venetian blinds enhanced with a learning module was developed and validated for 22 days in a daylighting testbed at the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy (ISE) in Freiburg, Germany. It has been shown that the visual comfort constraints are respected for 96% of the work hours and that the controller can successfully limit the number of shading movements.    The market potential for HDR vision sensors and integrated control platforms has been studied and possible commercialization tracks have been identified"

                        "S": "The ability to climb with adhesive pads conveys significant advantages and is widespread in the animal kingdom. The physics of adhesion predict that attachment is more challenging for large animals, whereas detachment is harder for small animals, due to the difference in surface-to-volume ratios. Here, we use stick insects to show that this problem is solved at both ends of the scale by linking adhesion to the applied shear force. Adhesive forces of individual insect pads, measured with perpendicular pull-offs, increased approximately in proportion to a linear pad dimension across instars. In sharp contrast, whole-body force measurements suggested area scaling of adhesion. This discrepancy is explained by the presence of shear forces during whole-body measurements, as confirmed in experiments with pads sheared prior to detachment. When we applied shear forces proportional to either pad area or body weight, pad adhesion also scaled approximately with area or mass, respectively, providing a mechanism that can compensate for the size-related loss of adhesive performance predicted by isometry. We demonstrate that the adhesion-enhancing effect of shear forces is linked to pad sliding, which increased the maximum adhesive force per area sustainable by the pads. As shear forces in natural conditions are expected to scale with mass, sliding is more frequent and extensive in large animals, thus ensuring that large animals can attach safely, while small animals can still detach their pads effortlessly. Our results therefore help to explain how nature's climbers maintain a dynamic attachment performance across seven orders of magnitude in body weight"

                        "S": "Glare indices have yet to be extensively tested in daylit open plan offices, as such there is no effective method to predict discomfort glare within these spaces. This study into discomfort glare in open plan green buildings targeted full-time employees, working under their everyday lighting conditions. Three green buildings in Brisbane were used for data collection, two were Green Star accredited and the other contained innovative daylighting strategies. Data were collected on full-time employees, mostly aged between 30 and 50 years, who broadly reflect the demographics of the wider working population in Australia. It was discovered 36 of the 64 respondents experienced discomfort from both electric and daylight sources at their workspace. The study used a specially tailored post-occupancy evaluation (POE) survey to help assess discomfort glare. Luminance maps extracted from High Dynamic Range (HDR) images were used to capture the luminous environment of the occupants. These were analysed using participant data and the program Evalglare. The physical results indicated no correlation with other developed glare metrics for daylight within these open plan green buildings, including the recently developed Daylight Glare Probability (DGP) Index. The strong influence of vertical illuminance, Ev in the DGP precludes the mostly contrast-based glare from windows observed in this investigation from forming a significant part of this index. Furthermore, critical assessment of the survey techniques used are considered.

In this study, we have investigated the adhesion and friction behavior of toe pads of White's tree frog (Litoria caerulea) using atomic force microscopy (AFM) in an aqueous medium. Facilitating special types of AFM probes with radii of ~400 nm and ~13 μm, we were able to sense the frictional response without damaging the delicate nanopillar structures of the epithelial cells. While we observed no significant adhesion between both types of probes and toe pads in wet conditions, frictional forces under such conditions were very pronounced and friction coefficients amounted between 0.3 and 1.1 for the sliding friction between probes and the epithelial cell surfaces"

                        "S": "Luminance adjustment is widely used to evaluate discomfort due to glare. This paper reports an experiment conducted to investigate two factors of the luminance adjustment procedure, stimulus range bias and direct vs indirect control. Stimulus range bias describes the influence on subjective evaluations of the range of stimuli available to the test observer, with range being the minimum and maximum available glare source luminance in the current context. For the glare source, an artificial window, there were three ranges, having maximum luminances of 5 106, 7 288 and 9 469 cd/m 2. The results suggest that luminance range had a significant effect on settings made, sufficient to change settings by an amount equivalent to one step of a Hopkinson-like discomfort sensation scale. The mean luminance associated with just intolerable discomfort with the low range was less than that associated with just uncomfortable with the high range. Past experiments have used direct control, where the observer makes the adjustment directly, and indirect control, where the observer instructs the experimenter to make the adjustment actions. Both methods were used in the current experiment. It was found that range bias was larger when using direct control than with indirect control. These findings contribute to an understanding of why different studies of discomfort glare have reported different results and hence proposed different discomfort models"

Rough  surfaces can alter the effectiveness of their toe pads, due to factors such as a change of real contact area and abrasion of the pad  epithelium. Here, we tested the effect of surface roughness on the attachment abilities of the tree frog Litoria caerulea. This was  done by testing shear and adhesive forces on artificial surfaces with controlled roughness, both on single toe pads and whole animal  scales. It was shown that frogs can stick 2–3 times better on small scale roughnesses (3–6 µm asperities), producing higher adhesive  and frictional forces, but relatively poorly on the larger scale roughnesses tested (58.5–562.5 µm asperities). Our experiments  suggested that, on such surfaces, the pads secrete insufficient fluid to fill the space under the pad, leaving air pockets that would  significantly reduce the Laplace pressure component of capillarity. Therefore, we measured how well the adhesive toe pad would  conform to spherical asperities of known sizes using interference reflection microscopy. Based on experiments where the conformation  of the pad to individual asperities was examined microscopically, our calculations indicate that the pad epithelium has a low  elastic modulus, making it highly deformable"

                        "S": "The adhesive mechanisms of climbing animals have become an important research topic because of their biomimetic implications. We examined the climbing abilities of hylid tree frogs on vertical cylinders of differing diameter and surface roughness to investigate the relative roles of adduction forces (gripping) and adhesion. Tree frogs adhere using their toe pads and subarticular tubercles, the adhesive joint being fluid-filled. Our hypothesis was that, on an effectively flat surface (adduction forces on the largest 120 mm diameter cylinder were insufficient to allow climbing), adhesion would effectively be the only means by which tree frogs could climb, but on the two smaller diameter cylinders (44 mm and 13 mm), frogs could additionally utilise adduction forces by gripping the cylinder either with their limbs outstretched or by grasping around the cylinder with their digits, respectively. The frogs' performance would also depend on whether the surfaces were smooth (easy to adhere to) or rough (relatively non-adhesive). Our findings showed that climbing performance was highest on the narrowest smooth cylinder. Frogs climbed faster, frequently using a 'walking trot' gait rather than the 'lateral sequence walk' used on other cylinders. Using an optical technique to visualize substrate contact during climbing on smooth surfaces, we also observed an increasing engagement of the subarticular tubercles on the narrower cylinders. Finally, on the rough substrate, frogs were unable to climb the largest diameter cylinder, but were able to climb the narrowest one slowly. These results support our hypotheses and have relevance for the design of climbing robots"

One recommended step for good practise in a category rating procedure is to use a pre-trial demonstration (PTD) of the range of stimuli to be experienced. However, PTD have rarely, if at all, been used in past research on discomfort glare. In this study, two experiments were conducted to test the influence of the PTD on evaluations of discomfort due to glare. In the first experiment participants evaluated four glare source luminances with, and without, a PTD. The results suggest that using a PTD increased the reported degree of discomfort perceived for the same glare setting, although this may depend on the manner in which the PTD is presented. In the second experiment, participants evaluated four glare source luminances using PTD with three different luminance ranges: the results suggest this had significant effect on discomfort evaluations in that evaluations of discomfort were lower when a higher luminance range was used. Along with other recent studies, these findings suggest a need to derive a more robust procedure for measuring the discomfort due to glare"

This study compares the adhesive capabilities of a torrent frog to a tree frog, investigating possible adaptations for adhesion under wet conditions. We challenged both frog species to cling to a platform which could be tilted from the horizontal to an upside-down orientation, testing the frogs on different levels of roughness and water flow. On dry, smooth surfaces, both frog species stayed attached to overhanging slopes equally well. In contrast, under both low and high flow rate conditions, the torrent frogs performed significantly better, even adhering under conditions where their toe pads were submerged in water, abolishing the meniscus that underlies capillarity. Using a transparent platform where areas of contact are illuminated, we measured the contact area of frogs during platform rotation under dry conditions. Both frog species not only used the contact area of their pads to adhere, but also large parts of their belly and thigh skin. In the tree frogs, the belly and thighs often detached on steeper slopes, whereas the torrent frogs increased the use of these areas as the slope angle increased. Probing small areas of the different skin parts with a force transducer revealed that forces declined significantly in wet conditions, with only minor differences between the frog species. The superior abilities of the torrent frogs were thus due to the large contact area they used on steep, overhanging surfaces. SEM images revealed slightly elongated cells in the periphery of the toe pads in the torrent frogs, with straightened channels in between them which could facilitate drainage of excess fluid underneath the pad"

                        "S": "The toe pads of frogs consist of soft hexagonal structures and a viscous liquid contained between and within the hexagonal structures. It has been hypothesized that this configuration creates adhesion by allowing for long range capillary forces, or alternatively, by allowing for exit of the liquid and thus improving contact of the toe pad. In this work we suggest interaction between viscosity and elasticity as a mechanism to create temporary adhesion, even in the absence of capillary effects or van der Waals forces. We initially illustrate this concept experimentally by a simplified configuration consisting of two surfaces connected by a liquid bridge and elastic springs. We then utilize poroelastic mixture theory and model frog's toe pads as an elastic porous medium, immersed within a viscous liquid and pressed against a rigid rough surface. The flow between the surface and the toe pad is modeled by the lubrication approximation. Inertia is neglected and analysis of the elastic-viscous dynamics yields a governing partial differential equation describing the flow and stress within the porous medium. Several solutions of the governing equation are presented and show a temporary adhesion due to stress created at the contact surface between the solids. This work thus may explain how some frogs (such as the torrent frog) maintain adhesion underwater and the reason for the periodic repositioning of frogs' toe pads during adhesion to surfaces"

One such example is the nanocomposite structure of keratinized epithelium on the toe pad of tree frogs, in which hexagonal arrays of (soft) epithelial cells are crossed by densely packed and oriented (hard) keratin nanofibrils. Here, a method is established to fabricate arrays of tree-frog-inspired composite micropatterns composed of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) micropillars embedded with polystyrene (PS) nanopillars. Adhesive and frictional studies of these synthetic materials reveal a benefit of the hierarchical and anisotropic design for both adhesion and friction, in particular, at high matrix-fiber interfacial strengths. The presence of PS nanopillars alters the stress distribution at the contact interface of micropillars and therefore enhances the adhesion and friction of the composite micropattern. The results suggest a design principle for bioinspired structural adhesives, especially for wet environments"

                        "S": "Replicating scientific findings is a fundamental aspect of research. However, in studies of discomfort due to glare, it is difficult to make comparisons between the results of different experiments since the statistical tests usually reported do not allow independent findings to be directly compared to each other. Here we present an alternative Bayesian approach that can address this problem. To show how this approach works, we performed a laboratory test with 55 participants to validate the effect of order bias previously detected in a similar study evaluating discomfort due to glare but, this time, under a large luminous source. Using the luminance adjustment procedure, the glare source was varied to meet four sensations of discomfort due to glare. Adjustments were performed under three different order sequences: ascending, descending, and randomised. Test participants provided glare settings using a newly proposed evaluation scale. The effect of order bias detected in the original study was compared to the data obtained with the same methodological procedure in the new experiment using Bayesian inferential tests. The results showed a close replication, highlighting that the order bias effect found in the original study was also present in the new experiment. The wide application of Bayesian methods in the design and analysis of experimental studies may improve the accuracy and validity of glare models"

                        "S": "The paper will focus on the role of computational design and digital fabrication in the processes of urban and architectural self-regeneration of existing infrastructures and buildings. The Architectural Fabrication research agenda takes inspiration from some of the concepts mentioned in Christopher Alexander’s essay ‘Systems generating systems’ (1968). It aims at introducing ways in which systems thinking and computer aided manufacturing can be most directly applied to the built environment. Hacking architectural spaces, by evolving their genetic spatial and structural codes, is developing the idea of optimizing resources involving inhabitants rather than generating other top down architectural solutions. During the last decades (starting from the book of Mario Carpo, ‘The Digital Turn in Architecture’) the digital shift in architectural design has generated a new discipline with the aim to define an innovative way to bridge the notion of nature with the one of teknè. From such a cultural milieu many research agenda were focusing on the concepts of morphogenesis and evolutionary thinking inspired by the work of French philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari based on the theory of complex systems. Despite this interest in bridging an evolutionary approach with the notion of emergent technologies in architecture (well described in the book ‘The Architecture of Emergence’ of Michael Weinstock) only a very few researchers have investigated on the potential of computational design as a driver for the ecological rehabilitation of existing infrastructures. As a matter of fact, the computational designers were so worried to claim for a new aesthetical identity of their discipline while a new opportunity was emerging for applying this evolutionary approach in order to hack existing structures. The idea of living infrastructures is related to the possibility of developing contextual algorithms in order to customize standard solutions with a post-human process that creates diversified spatial configurations out of very rigid organizational systems. Therefore, the paper will also talk about the Hacking Gomorra project as a possible paradigm of experimenting a 3D printing protocol for the environmental rehabilitation of a mega-structural housing building in Naples (Italy)"

Glare indices were calculated for every reported GSV, and results were statistically analysed. The findings indicated a tendency towards greater tolerance to luminance increases in artificial lighting as the day progresses. This trend was found not to be statistically related to the possible confounding variable of learning, providing evidence of an effect of time of the day on glare sensation"

However, these surfaces lose their superhydrophobic functions once being contaminated by oily liquids. In this work a simple chemical bath deposition method is reported to fabricate superoleophobic surfaces on steel substrates that repel both water and oil. The synthesis of superoleophobic surfaces involves the fabrication of the micro/nanometre-scale origami-ball-like structures on steel substrates, followed by the modification of low surface energy material. The fabricated surfaces have glycerol, peanut oil and hexadecane contact angles larger than 150° and roll-off angles smaller than 10°. This method is highly efficient because it takes only 5 min to create the surface re-entrant structures that are required by superoleophobicity. The prepared surfaces showed remarkable durability and retained superoleophobicity even after exposure to high and low temperatures (−30 and 100°C), and UV irradiation. This work will enrich the processing methods of the superoleophobic surfaces on stainless steel substrates"

                        "S": "The effect of electrospinning operational parameters on the morphology, surface roughness, and wettability of different compositions of electrospun polystyrene (PS)-aluminum oxide (Al2O3) nanocomposite coatings was investigated using different techniques. For example, a scanning electron microscope (SEM) coupled with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) unit, a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer, an atomic force microscope (AFM), and water contact angle (WCA), and contact angle hysteresis (CAH) measurements using the sessile droplet method, were used. The latter used 4 μL of distilled water at room temperature. PS/Al2O3 nanocomposite coatings exhibited different morphologies, such as beaded fibers and microfibers, depending on the concentration ratio between the PS and Al2O3 nanoparticles and the operational parameters of the electrospinning process. The optimum conditions to produce a nanocomposite coating with the highest roughness and superhydrophobic properties (155° ± 1.9° for WCA and 3° ± 4.2° for CAH) are 2.5 and 0.25 wt % of PS and Al2O3, respectively, 25 kV for the applied potential and 1.5 mL·h-1 for the solution flow rate at 35 °C. The corrosion resistance of the as-prepared coatings was investigated using the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique. The results have revealed that the highly porous superhydrophobic nanocomposite coatings (SHCs) possess a superior corrosion resistance that is higher than the uncoated Al alloy by three orders of magnitude. © 2018 by the authors.Acknowledgments: This publication was supported by Qatar University Internal Grant No. GCC-2017-012.

                        "S": "Existing glare metrics are usually tested in controlled studies and have certain limitations when predicting extremely bright scenes typical of clear sky with great daylight availability. A field-based research was carried out, where 26 real offices with direct sunlight were evaluated. Different daylight glare metrics were selected (luminance and illuminance levels, luminance ratios, luminance distribution). These were divided into two categories: “absolute glare values” and “relative glare values” following a study made by Suk et al. [22]. The contributions of these metrics about glare sensation (GSV scale) were statistically analyzed. In addition, the DGP model and uniformity values were calculated to complement this analysis. This paper demonstrates that Suk's proposal is a viable alternative; however, the “percentage of central and near FOV with luminance greater than 2000 cd/m2” metric showed a better correlation with the subjective response. Finally, a glare equation based on an absolute and a relative glare factor was proposed. This model is recommended to be used specifically when direct sunlight is present in the work area.Fil: Yamin Garretón, Julieta Alejandra. Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas.

                        "S": "While windows connect inside to outside, daylight entering through windows is a key element in architectural design. Although electrical lighting is able to replace daylight as an essential lighting requirement, daylight has qualitative and quantitative aspects that distinguish it from its competitor, electrical lighting.  One of the most unique characteristics of daylight is its variability in time, including different qualities of daylighting from sunset to sunrise, and from equinox to solstice. In addition, by regulating a circadian rhythm and hormone secretion, daylight impacts the physiological and psychological well-being of human beings. Moreover, daylight through windows carries information that flows from outside to inside and makes occupants aware of the outside world. While availability of daylight has been praised in building design, uneven distribution of daylight, reflective surfaces and excessive daylight may cause glare issues and visual discomfort which need to be avoided in daylight design. Beyond all the qualitative aspects of daylight, daylight, as a free resource, is able to illuminate the space and replace electrical lighting and lower electricity utility bills.  This quantitative aspect of daylight has been the center of attention among researchers, designers and builders, as lowering CO₂ emissions and environmental design have gained momentum in the building industry. Different stakeholders have various interests in qualitative and quantitative aspects of daylight, which eventually shape the design context. The interests of different stakeholders, including owners, environmentalists and occupants, may merge or conflict in different projects, which shows that daylight quality and quantity may have different weights, depending on the context of the project at hand.  This dissertation aims to provide an algorithmic platform to consider a context for skylight design by including all the interests of different stakeholders while either scaling importance of the different interests or requiring minimum qualities and performance targets. This dissertation proposes different methodological approaches for its platform to include both qualitative and quantitative aspects in designing skylights for a one-storey office building in different climates. Three different approaches are proposed in this dissertation, encompassing unconstrained optimization, constrained optimization and monetary metrics.  In the unconstrained optimization approach, the algorithmic platform has been developed to implement Parametric Analysis (PA) and Gradient Descent (GD) methods in order to optimize Skylight to Floor area Ratio (SFR) while saving energy consumption, as a quantitative aspect of daylight, and improving daylighting quality by providing sufficient daylight without causing glare discomfort. This platform was built as an Inclusive Integrative Algorithm (IIA) to weight different qualitative and quantitative aspects of daylight. The algorithm is able to perform single or multi-objective optimization by either applying GD or PA. In this approach, a single-objective optimization, considering only energy efficiency, showed that the optimal SFR was 6% in the examined climates of Austin, Chicago and San Francisco, for 300 lux lighting level and Lighting Power Density of 0.8 watt/sqft. The unconstrained optimization approach implemented a weighting system for an aggregated metric, including Mean Daylight (MD) and imperceptible Daylight Glare Probability (iDGP) and Ratio of Energy Saving (RES), which resulted in a SFR of 11% as the inclusive optimal solution for all the examined climates.  In addition to the discussion of inclusive optimization considering both daylight and energy performance and scaling their importance, this dissertation initiated the use of GD for the unconstrained optimization in single and multi-objective optimization. The result showed that GD is considerably faster than the traditional method, PA, while predicting the optimal solution with higher resolution. For example, GD resulted in 6.22% SFR for the San Francisco climate as an energy efficient optimal solution by only 9 iterations. However, PA required 10,000 iterations to find the optimal solution with the same resolution. Thus, GD has shown a promising result for the future of multi-objective optimization in building design. In addition to the unconstrained optimization, this dissertation applied the second approach, constrained optimization, by imposing different thresholds for two sets of metrics, including daylight availability and glare. Where Useful Daylight Illuminance (UDI) and spatial Daylight Autonomy (sDA) of 100% were used, the inclusive optimal SFRs were 9-10%, 8-10% and 9% for the climates of San Francisco, Austin and Chicago, respectively. For the other set of daylight metrics, MD of 50% and Mean Daylight Glare Probability (mDGP) of 35% were used, which resulted in optimal solutions of 7-14%, 7-11% and 8-13% SFR for San Francisco, Austin and Chicago, respectively. Therefore, multi-objective optimization considering both daylight and energy performance resulted in different inclusive optimal solutions to energy optimization alone. The study also concludes that optimal solutions depend on applied metrics and daylight thresholds. For the third approach this research investigated the monetary gains from energy efficiency and increased productivity. Assuming that productivity does not occur in spaces with poor daylight performance, inclusive optimal solutions will be the scenarios that most probably boost productivity. The study indicated that the energy cost saving is always negligible compared to the monetary gains from minimum increased productivity (1%). This conclusion may influence an owner’s perspective toward the quality of daylight performance and its resultant productivity increase. Although the proposed algorithm (IIA) has been used to perform multi-objective optimization for skylight design, this platform can be used in the design process to optimize any fenestration, including widows, based on daylight availability, glare and energy factors. GD as one of the contributions of this dissertation is a faster and more accurate method which can facilitate the application of multi-objective optimization for daylight analysis in the early stage of design.Architectur"

The electrospinning technique makes the fabrication of highly crosslinked electrospun fibers possible by the combination of both poly(acrylic acid) and beta-cyclodextrin, respectively, which can be easily functionalized in a further step by using the CVD-silanization process due to the evaporation of a hydrophobic molecule such as 1H,1H,2H,2H-Perflurodecyltriethoxysilane. In addition, the resultant electrospun fibers with a high degree of insolubility have been successfully fabricated and metal oxide nanoparticles (TiO(2)NPs) have been incorporated into the electrospun polymeric solution in order to improve the corrosion protection. The surface morphology has been determined by using light optical microscopy, atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and water contact angle (WCA) measurements. The corrosion resistance has been evaluated by using both potentiodynamic polarization and pitting corrosion tests. Finally, the results related to WCA measurements after CVD-silanization corroborate that the surfaces have been successfully functionalized with a hydrophobic behavior in comparison with the electrospinning process, showing a considerable difference in the roughness.This work was funded by the Spanish Economy and Competitiveness Ministry-FEDER Proyecto Retos (TRA2013-48603-C4-1-R) and the Public University (Navarre-PRO-UPNA18 (6107))"

                        "S": "Electrospinning has gained wide attention recently in biomedical applications. Electrospun biocompatible scaffolds are well-known for biomedical applications such as drug delivery, wound dressing, and tissue engineering applications. In this review, the synthesis of polymer-based fiber composites using an electrospinning technique is discussed. Formerly, metal particles were then deposited on the surface of electrospun fibers using sputtering technology. Key nanometals for biomedical applications including silver and copper nanoparticles are discussed throughout this review. The formulated scaffolds were found to be suitable candidates for biomedical uses such as antibacterial coatings, surface modification for improving biocompatibility, and tissue engineering. This review briefly mentions the characteristics of the nanostructures while focusing on how nanostructures hold potential for a wide range of biomedical applications.This work was funded by Qatar University, grant number GCC-2017-007 and the publication of this article was funded by the Qatar National Library.Scopu"

The use of this new type of microactuator in responsive architectural components presents a challenge because of the limited contraction state of the SMAs. Hence, origami shapes were considered to amplify shading movements thanks to their geometric properties. This study exploited the visual and thermal comfort of a south-oriented office located in Milan, Italy, that was equipped with adaptive origami shading. Two-hundred and ten shapes were considered and the geometry, contraction states, and surface materials were considered as variable properties. The final aim was to explore the potential of adaptive origami shadings in controlling visual and thermal comfort. Daylight illuminance (UDI), daylight glare probability (DGP), and total energy (TE) demand (for cooling, heating, and lighting per year) were used as main metrics for understanding the environmental benefits of the proposed shading devices"

                        "S": "Electrospinning is a versatile process technology, exploited for the production of fibers with varying diameters, ranging from nano- to micro-scale, particularly useful for a wide range of applications. Among these, tissue engineering is particularly relevant to this technology since electrospun fibers offer topological structure features similar to the native extracellular matrix, thus providing an excellent environment for the growth of cells and tissues. Recently, nanocarbons have been emerging as promising fillers for biopolymeric nanofibrous scaffolds. In fact, they offer interesting physicochemical properties due to their small size, large surface area, high electrical conductivity and ability to interface/interact with the cells/tissues. Nevertheless, their biocompatibility is currently under debate and strictly correlated to their surface characteristics, in terms of chemical composition, hydrophilicity and roughness. Among the several nanofibrous scaffolds prepared by electrospinning, biopolymer/nanocarbons systems exhibit huge potential applications, since they combine the features of the matrix with those determined by the nanocarbons, such as conductivity and improved bioactivity. Furthermore, combining nanocarbons and electrospinning allows designing structures with engineered patterns at both nano- and microscale level. This article presents a comprehensive review of various types of electrospun polymer-nanocarbon currently used for tissue engineering applications. Furthermore, the differences among graphene, carbon nanotubes, nanodiamonds and fullerenes and their effect on the ultimate properties of the polymer-based nanofibrous scaffolds is elucidated and critically reviewed"

The goal is to define a shading system for office buildings that delivers visual comfort for users whilst reducing energy consumption for indoor climate control and artificial lighting.As the design of the shading system considers the use of shape memory alloys (SMA) as micro-actuators to accomplish solar adaptation, Origami pattern has been adopted to guarantee a relatively large displacement of the shading system with a small deformation of the SMA wires actuators. Thanks to this shape change, generating overlapped pleats and angle variation and using different materials, it has been possible to provide alterations of the direct light transmission inside the building while maintaining a certain degree of diffuse light component"

                        "S": "Cardiac cell therapy holds a real promise for improving heart function and especially of the chronically failing myocardium. Embedding cells into 3D biodegradable scaffolds may better preserve cell survival and enhance cell engraftment after transplantation, consequently improving cardiac cell therapy compared with direct intramyocardial injection of isolated cells. The primary objective of a scaffold used in tissue engineering is the recreation of the natural 3D environment most suitable for an adequate tissue growth. An important aspect of this commitment is to mimic the fibrillar structure of the extracellular matrix, which provides essential guidance for cell organization, survival, and function. Recent advances in nanotechnology have significantly improved our capacities to mimic the extracellular matrix. Among them, electrospinning is well known for being easy to process and cost effective. Consequently, it is becoming increasingly popular for biomedical applications and it is most definitely the cutting edge technique to make scaffolds that mimic the extracellular matrix for industrial applications. Here, the desirable physico-chemical properties of the electrospun scaffolds for cardiac therapy are described, and polymers are categorized to natural and synthetic.Moreover, the methods used for improving functionalities by providing cells with the necessary chemical cues and a more in vivo- like environment are reported"

                        "S": "In the field of responsive shading systems, the use of photobioreactors (PBRs) containing microalgae seems to be a promising technology. Within this framework, this paper presents a case study where a PBR was specifically conceived as a shading system for an external workspace located on an open terrace of the State Library of Queensland (SLQ) in Brisbane. The proposed shading system makes use of PBRs as translucent screening elements, capable of regulating natural light to provide adequate visual comfort for a multi-purpose workspace, despite exposure of the site to direct sunlight and fluctuating weather conditions. The microalgae (Scenedesmus Obliquus) cultivated within the shading elements contribute to improving the environment by bio-sequestrating CO2 and producing oxygen. They are also a valuable raw material containing bioactive compounds with various applications including nutraceutical products, livestock feed, and biofuel synthesis. In addition, their green pigmentation is visually engaging and allows for the filtration of solar radiation. The paper focuses on analyzing the daylight performance in the outdoor workplace under the PBR shade. The biomass density of the PBR is adjustable across a wide range of light transmittances (10%-80%) to counter the highly variable outdoor conditions. For different Tv values, illuminance values were calculated using the simulation tool DIVA-for-Rhino and then analyzed as both point-in-time illuminance in June, September and December, and through climate-based daylight metrics such as the Daylight Autonomy and the Useful Daylight Illuminance. As a further step, the daylighting performances were compared to two other climates (Turin, Italy, and Dubai, United Arab Emirates), to verify which setting of the PBR may be suitable for different boundary conditions, thus making the system more widely applicable. The results in Brisbane showed that for clear sky conditions, higher levels of biomass saturation are needed (Tv < 20%) to remain in the 300-3000 lx ‘optimal’ illuminance comfort range, with lower concentrations (Tv < 30%) to remain within the 300-6000 lx ‘acceptable’ illuminance comfort range. Differently, in overcast sky conditions, the optimal range of illuminance is easily obtained with reduced levels of biomass saturation (Tv < 80%)"

                        "S": "Electrospun fiber scaffolds have a huge potential for the successful treatment of infected wounds based on their unique properties. Although several studies report novel drug-loaded electrospun fiber-based biomaterials, many of these do not provide information on their interactions with eukaryotic and bacterial cells. The main aim of this study was to develop antibacterial drug-loaded porous biocompatible polycaprolactone (PCL) fiber scaffolds mimicking the native extracellular matrix for wound healing purposes. Mechanical property evaluation and different biorelevant tests were conducted in order to understand the structure-activity relationships and reveal how the surface porosity of fibers and the fiber diameter affect the scaffold interactions with the living bacterial and eukaryotic fibroblast cells. Cell migration and proliferation assays and antibiofilm assays enabled us to enlighten the biocompatibility and safety of fiber scaffolds and their suitability to be used as scaffolds for the treatment of infected wounds. Here, we report that porous PCL microfiber scaffolds obtained using electrospinning at high relative humidity served as the best surfaces for fibroblast attachment and growth compared to the nonporous microfiber or nonporous nanofiber PCL scaffolds. Porous chloramphenicol-loaded microfiber scaffolds were more elastic compared to nonporous scaffolds and had the highest antibiofilm activity. The results indicate that in addition to the fiber diameter and fiber scaffold porosity, the single-fiber surface porosity and its effect on drug release, mechanical properties, cell viability, and antibiofilm activity need to be understood when developing antibacterial biocompatible scaffolds for wound healing applications. We show that pores on single fibers within an electrospun scaffold, in addition to nano- and microscale diameter of the fibers, change the living cell-fiber interactions affecting the antibiofilm efficacy and biocompatibility of the scaffolds for the local treatment of wounds"

SEM images illustrated that the morphology of all electrospun fiber mats was smooth, uniform, and bead-free. The average fiber diameter was reduced by the addition of PEP from 1.6 ± 0.1 to 1.0 ± 0.2 μm. Functional groups of the fibers were determined by Raman spectroscopy. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) analysis demonstrated the actual PEP content in the samples. In vitro degradation was determined by measuring weight loss and their morphology change, showing that the electrospun fibers slightly degraded by the addition of PEP. The wettability of PCL and PEP loaded electrospun fiber mats was measured by determining contact angle and it was shown that wettability increased with the incorporation of PEP. The antimicrobial activity results revealed that PEP loaded PCL electrospun fiber mats exhibited inhibition against Staphylococcus aureus (gram-positive) and Escherichia coli (gram-negative) bacteria. In addition, an in-vitro cell viability assay using normal human dermal fibroblast (NHDF) cells revealed improved cell viability on PCL, PCLPEP1.5, PCLPEP3, and PCLGEL6 electrospun fiber mats compared to the control (CNT) after 48 h cell culture. Our findings showed for the first time PEP loaded PCL electrospun fiber mats with antibiotic-free antibacterial activity as promising candidates for wound healing applications"

                        "S": "Currently, home-based computing workspaces have developed substantially all over the world, especially in Malaysia. This growing trend attracts computer workers to run a business from their residential units. Hence, visual comfort needs to be considered in addition to thermal comfort for home workers in their residential working rooms. While such rooms are always occupied with furniture, the layout of the furniture may influence the indoor daylighting distribution. Several various furniture layouts can be arranged in a residential working room. However, to have better generalisation, this study focused on the impacts of mostly-used-furniture-layouts (MUFLs) on indoor daylighting performance in residential working rooms. The field measurement was conducted in a typically furnished room under a tropical sky to validate the results of the simulation software under different sky conditions. Then, daylight ratio (DR), as a quantitative daylighting variable, and the illuminance uniformity ratio (IUR), CIE glare index (CGI), and Guth visual comfort probability (GVCP), as qualitative daylighting variables, were analysed through simulation experiments. In conclusion, by changing the furniture layout, daylight uniformity recorded the highest fluctuations in the case room among all variables. While various furniture layouts, in a residential working room in the tropics, may even slightly reduce the extreme indoor daylight quantity, they can worsen the indoor daylight quality compared to an unfurnished space. The paper shows that furniture as an interior design parameter cannot help to improve tropical daylighting performance in a building"

Obstructions, such as furniture and household items, may block the existing windows, and therefore affect interior daylight conditions. A facade design approach is needed that simultaneously takes into account daylighting and the volume of usable space for obstructions in the perimeter zone of such rooms. This study simulates daylight distributions in a typical small residential room with obstructions in front of windows. The simulation consists of two parts. First, the effects on horizontal illuminances caused by different positions and shapes of obstructions are examined under an overcast sky. Second, the maximum usable space volumes for obstructions of 51 optimized facade configurations are calculated in terms of four window-to-wall ratios (WWRs). The results of this study show that optimizing the forms of facade design can increase the usable interior space volume and meet the daylighting requirements of Chinese standards for small residential rooms. Additionally, by using the optimized facade forms, a facade with a WWR value of 50% provides the maximum usable space for obstructions. Based on the above results, this paper presents two matrices that can help architects in selecting the appropriate fenestration methods and confirming the size of usable space and allocation for residents"

The analysis was carried out through a set of simulations, performed by the Radiance engine managed through Honeybee. As an input for the simulations, the visible transmittance Tv of PCM in solid (diffusing) state was used, based on previous laboratory measurements. The simulations were run for several specific times of the year: The two solstices and the autumn equinox, for different hours during the day. Other variables investigated were the site (Östersund, 63.2° N; Turin, 45.2° N; Abu Dhabi, 24.4° N), the room orientation (south; west), and the sky conditions (clear sky with sun; overcast). For comparative purpose, the simulations were repeated for the same boundary conditions in a room equipped with a selective glazing, with a Tv of 0.5. For each case, the visual comfort perceived by the occupants has been analyzed in terms of Daylight Glare Probability (DGP) in two different points in the room and of “Spatial Useful Illuminance” (percent of work plane points where the illuminance lies in the range 100–3000 lx). The results showed that the glazed package with PCM in most cases admits more daylight into the room, resulting into an increased glare (DGP values), but also in lower Spatial Useful Illuminance values"

                        "S": "The inclusion of daylight in buildings represents several benefits: its use not only signifies a reduction in the building energy consumption through the compensation of electric lighting, it also has positive effects in the execution of human activities. Through its spectral composition, it contributes to create a better interior atmosphere for visual comfort, leading to a better performance on working tasks. It also influences biological human cycles, which has an impact on human alertness, mood and well-being. Compared with electric light, its intensity and dynamic variations have a stimulating effect by providing a connection with the exterior environment. However, for buildings located at low latitudes (between 23°N and S), the inclusion of daylight implies the admission of sunrays, which affect the visual comfort and perception of the indoor environment by altering the interior luminance distribution increasing the risk of glare. An additional unfavourable effect is the increment of the interior thermal loads which represent a risk of overheating for the occupants. In those regions, common practices such as: the reduction of the window size, the use of tinted glazing and solar protection are usually applied to buildings in the search of overcoming such problems. However, the use of such strategies also implies a reduction of the admission of daylight inducing the use of electric light, which is incongruent in countries with large amounts of this natural resource. The use of Complex Fenestration Systems (CFS) may represent a solution given their characteristics: daylight redirection and direct solar rays protection. The latter would contribute to control the admission of solar gains while maintaining a good visual interior environment. However, the appropriate selection of CFS requires a careful evaluation of their features and performance regarding their suitability to the building location. This thesis explores the potentiality of using CFS to improve the interior daylight distribution in buildings located at low latitudes while maintaining a satisfactory visual and thermal interior environment for the occupants. In order to do this, the existing daylight situation of two office rooms located in the central-north of México (Zacatecas 22° 783' N., 102° 583' W, Altitude: 2543m) were monitored from 2011 to 2013. Illuminance and luminance were measured on periods of the year that are crucial for the interior luminous environment (summer and winter solstices together with spring equinox), in order to characterize the existing daylighting situation and to study the dispersion of results obtained using a virtual model which reproduces the features of both offices. The performance of five CFS was then tested using computer simulations in order to assess their suitability to the local sky conditions. For this, three main factors were taken into account: the improvement of the interior daylight distribution, the risk of glare and overheating. The effects of the CFS in a room regarding such conditions were simulated using RADIANCE and Energy Plus using BTDF data (Bidirectional Transmission Distribution Function that characterizes the CFS’s lighting transmission properties) assessed by the use of a gonio-photometer. The assessment was performed first during the winter and summer solstices as well as spring equinox and secondly then on annual basis. The latter was done in order to take into account the daylight variation characteristics of two locations with prevailing clear sky conditions. The results obtained allow determining the CFS that better contributes to a better interior luminous environment in each building without compromising the thermal and visual comfort of the occupants"

                        "S": "Window systems play a key role in establishing both the thermal and luminous environments within buildings, as well as the consequent energy required to maintain these for the comfort of their occupants. Various strategies have been employed to improve the thermal and optical performance of window systems. Some of these approaches result in products with relatively complex structures. Thus, it becomes difficult to characterise their optical and thermal properties for use in building performance prediction. This review discusses the experimental and numerical methods used to predict the thermal and optical behaviour of complex window systems. Following a discussion of thermal characterisation methods available in the literature that include experimental test methods, theoretical calculation methods and Computational Fluid Dynamic methods, sophisticated optical methods, such as use of Bidirectional Scatter Distribution Functions (BSDF) to optically characterise complex window systems, are introduced. The application of BSDF allows advanced daylight assessment metrics along with daylight evaluation tools to be used to realise dynamic annual prediction of the luminous environment. Finally, this paper reviews methods that permit the prediction of the combined thermal, daylight and energy behaviour of buildings that make use of complex window systems"

A 32.7 kWp PV capacity is proposed for a roof building and its performance in BAPV and BIPV configurations with three PV technologies namely crystalline (c-Si), CIS, and CdTe is analyzed. The standard methodology with performance parameters such as energy yield (EY), yield factor (YF), capacity utilization factor (CUF), performance ratio (PR), and losses is used. It is found that the EY, YF, and year to year energy production variability of BIPV and BAPV technologies varies from 43,700–46,800 kW h, 1336.39–1431.19 kW h/kWp, and 1910–2100 kW h respectively. The CUF and PR vary from 15.25–16.33%, and 72.23–77.36% respectively. Irrespective of PV configuration and technology, observed losses due to the angle of incidence, spectral effects, effects of change in irradianceand module temperatures are observed to be − 2.8%, − 1 to − 5%, and − 7.4 to − 13.6% respectively. Total system losses range from −22.6 to 27.8% causing a fair amount of loss in the PV efficiency. Among, three PV technologies, CdTe is observed to perform better than CIS, and c-Si"
